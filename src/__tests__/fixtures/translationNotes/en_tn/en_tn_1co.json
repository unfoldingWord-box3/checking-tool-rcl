He speaks in this way to remind them that only one person can introduce them to the gospel, and anyone who tries to introduce them to another gospel is building a different house, not the same house. Paul then directly states that the **foundation** refers to the message about **Jesus Christ** that he preached to them and which should be the starting point and basis for everything else they learn about the gospel.

The quoted question is not asking for information. Instead, it assumes that the answer is “no one,” and the author used a question to make a negative claim that is stronger than a simple statement. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea behind the questionwith a strong negative statement.

In this clause, Paul clarifies that he is only speaking about **tongues** without interpretation.

This form does not mean that Paul is unsure about whether **prophecies**, **tongues**, and **knowledge** currently exist. Rather, Paul uses this form to identify each one as the topic of the rest of the clause. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea behind Paul’s use of **if** hereby using a contrast word such as “although” or by simplifying the clauses so that they do not use **if**.
