He wants them to think of him as if he were a **bridegroom** and of his disciples as if they were the **sons of the bridal chamber**. You should preserve the form of the parable, but if it would be helpful in your language, you could state explicitly that Jesus is like the **bridegroom**, and his disciples are like the **sons of the bridal chamber**. Alternate translation: “The sons of the bridal chamber are not able to fast while the bridegroom is still with them, are they? As much time as they have the bridegroom with them, they are not able to fast. But days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and in those days, then they will fast. I am like the bridegroom, and my disciples are like the sons of the bridal chamber.”",

However, Jesus does not explain the metaphor, and Christians disagree on what it means. If possible, preserve the metaphor or express the idea in simile form. If necessary, you could state more explicitly that Jesus is referring to some form of suffering and its effects on people.

He could be: (1) distinguishing between two groups, one group from Galilee who **followed** Jesus to the Sea of Galilee, and one group from all the other areas who traveled to meet Jesus by the Sea of Galilee.

And hearing how much he was doing, a great multitude from Judea and from Jerusalem and from Idumea and beyond the Jordan and around Tyre and Sidon came to him” (2) referring twice to the same group of people, who came from all these areas.
