The phrase **his fruit is sweet** means that he causes the woman to experience pleasurable feelings in a way that is comparable to eating sweet fruit. If it is possible in your language you should try to retain the images used here, or substitute a comparable image if needed. If you are not able to retain the metaphors without causing misunderstanding, you could use similes or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “He provides me with refreshment and protection when I am in his presence, he gives me great pleasure” or “I sit in his presence and he refreshes and protects me. He is delightful to me like sweet fruit”",

Because of this and because the phrases **A sister belongs to us** and **What will we do with our sister** in 8:8 seem to indicate that the woman’s brothers are speaking, the most likely view is that her brothers are the the ones speaking so if you choose to use headers you can place a header above 8:8-9, indicating that the woman’s brothers are speaking as modeled by the UST.",
