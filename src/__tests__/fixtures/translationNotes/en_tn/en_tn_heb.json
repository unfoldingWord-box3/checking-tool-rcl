First, Levi and the priests descended from him had not yet been born and thus could be considered to be inside Abraham. Second, because they were inside Abraham, they participated in whatever Abraham did. This included giving a tithe to Melchizedek. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a phrase that closely identifies Levi and Abraham, while showing that Levi was not yet born.
