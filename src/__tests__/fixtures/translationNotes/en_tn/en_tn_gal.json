If this is what Paul means here, then he is referring to the suffering that the Galatians believers experienced when they were persecuted. Alternate translation: “Keep in mind that if what God has done for you was because of your obeying the laws that God gave to Moses and not because of trusting in Christ, did you not suffer so many things needlessly? I certainly hope that you did not suffer like that needlessly” (2) the spiritual privileges and blessings that the Galatian believers had experienced such as receiving God’s Spirit and God “working miracles” among them, both of which are mentioned in the next verse. If your language does not allow you to use a neutral term but rather requires a more specific term, you could specify that the things the Galatians experienced were good things. Alternate translation: “Keep in mind that if the good things God has done for you were because you obeyed the laws that God gave to Moses and not because you trusted in Christ, then the good things God has done for you have been wasted. I certainly hope that the good things you have experienced have not been wasted” (3) both good things and bad things and be referring to both the persecution that the Galatians had experienced and the spiritual blessings that they had experienced. Because it is not known for sure the type of things to which Paul is referring, if possible you should try to use a neutral term or expression.
