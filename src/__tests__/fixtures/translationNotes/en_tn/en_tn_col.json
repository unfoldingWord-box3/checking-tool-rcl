In other words, Paul distinguishes them from all the other people who work with him, because these three men are the only ones who are circumcised Jews. Second, he describes them as ones **who have been a comfort** to him. Here, he is not distinguishing them from other fellow workers; instead, he just wishes to say that they have **been a comfort** to him. If these descriptions would be misunderstood in your language, you could translate the two descriptions differently so that it is clear that the first distinguishes the three men while the second describes the three men.
