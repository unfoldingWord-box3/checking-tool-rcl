You could include it at the beginning of the sentence, at the end of the sentence, or somewhere else.

The two most likely interpretations are that: (1) **she** (Eve or women in general) **will be saved** by God, who will use **childbearing** as the means by which he sends the Messiah into the world. In this case, **childbearing** describes one means by which God accomplishes salvation. Alternate translation: “she will be saved through how the Messiah came by means of women bearing children” (2) **she** (women in general) **will be saved** spiritually as they have children and act as mothers. In this case, **childbearing** describes the circumstances in which the women **will be saved**. Alternate translation: “they will be saved while they give birth and raise children”",
