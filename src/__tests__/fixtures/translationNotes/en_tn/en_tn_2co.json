He speaks in this way to indicate that everyone hears and reacts to the message about Christ, just like everyone smells and reacts to a strong odor. Also, just like a smell fills a whole room, so the good news fills **every place** on earth. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea by using a simile or plain language. Consider using a form that you can continue to use in the following two verses, in which Paul continues the **aroma** metaphor.

If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea with a simile or in some other natural way. Alternate translation: “you are like a letter of Christ having been administered by us, not written with ink but as if with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone but as if on tablets of hearts of flesh” or “you are a message from Christ having been administered by us, not communicated by ink but by the Spirit of the living God, not presented on tablets of stone but on tablets of hearts of flesh” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])",
