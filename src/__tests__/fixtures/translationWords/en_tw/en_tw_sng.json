      "abomination": "# abomination, abominable\n\n## Definition:\n\nThe term “abomination” is used to refer to something that causes disgust or extreme dislike.\n\n* The Egyptians considered the Hebrew people to be an “abomination.” This means that the Egyptians disliked the Hebrews and didn’t want to associate with them or be near them.\n* Some of the things that the Bible calls “an abomination to Yahweh” include lying, pride, sacrificing humans, worship of idols, murder, and sexual sins such as adultery and homosexual acts.\n* In teaching his disciples about the end times, Jesus referred to a prophecy by the prophet Daniel about an “abomination of desolation” that would be set up as a rebellion against God, defiling his place of worship.\n\n## Translation Suggestions:\n\n* The term “abomination” could also be translated by “something God hates” or “something disgusting” or “disgusting practice” or “very evil action.”\n* Depending on the context, ways to translate the phrase “is an abomination to” could include “is greatly hated by” or “is disgusting to” or “is totally unacceptable to” or “causes deep disgust.”\n* The phrase “abomination of desolation” could be translated as “defiling object that causes people to be greatly harmed” or “disgusting thing that causes great sorrow.”\n\n(See also: [adultery](../kt/adultery.md), [desecrate](../other/desecrate.md), [desolate](../other/desolate.md), [false god](../kt/falsegod.md), [sacrifice](../other/sacrifice.md))\n\n## Bible References:\n\n* [Ezra 9:1-2](rc://en/tn/help/ezr/09/01)\n* [Genesis 46:34](rc://en/tn/help/gen/46/34)\n* [Isaiah 1:13](rc://en/tn/help/isa/01/13)\n* [Matthew 24:15](rc://en/tn/help/mat/24/15)\n* [Proverbs 26:25](rc://en/tn/help/pro/26/25)\n\n## Word Data:\n\n* Strong’s: H0887, H6292, H8251, H8262, H8263, H8441, G09460\n",
      "adoption": "# adoption, adopt, adopted\n\n## Definition:\n\nThe terms “adopt” and “adoption” refer to the process of someone legally becoming the child of people who are not his biological parents.\n\n* The Bible uses “adoption” and “adopt” in a figurative way to describe how God causes people to be part of his family, making them his spiritual sons and daughters.\n* As adopted children, God makes believers to be co-heirs with Jesus Christ, giving them all of the privileges of sons and daughters of God.\n\n## Translation Suggestions:\n\n* This term could be translated with a term that the language of translation uses to describe this special parent-child relationship. Make sure it is understood that this has a figurative or spiritual meaning.\n* The phrase “experience adoption as sons” could be translated as “be adopted by God as his children” or “become God’s (spiritual) children.”\n* To “wait for the adoption of sons” could be translated as “look forward to becoming God’s children” or “wait expectantly for God to receive as children.”\n* The phrase “adopt them” could be translated as “receive them as his own children” or “make them his own (spiritual) children.”\n\n(See also: [heir](../other/heir.md), [inherit](../kt/inherit.md), [spirit](../kt/spirit.md))\n\n## Bible References:\n\n* [Ephesians 1:5](rc://en/tn/help/eph/01/5)\n* [Galatians 4:3-5](rc://en/tn/help/gal/04/03)\n* [Romans 8:14-15](rc://en/tn/help/rom/08/14)\n* [Romans 8:23](rc://en/tn/help/rom/08/23)\n* [Romans 9:4](rc://en/tn/help/rom/09/04)\n\n## Word Data:\n\n* Strong’s: G52060\n",

      "amen": "# amen, truly\n\n## Definition:\n\nThe term “amen” is a word used to emphasize or call attention to what a person has said. It is often used at the end of a prayer. Sometimes it is translated as “truly.”\n\n* When used at the end of a prayer, “amen” communicates agreement with the prayer or expresses a desire that the prayer be fulfilled.\n* In his teaching, Jesus used “amen” to emphasize the truth of what he said. He often followed that by “and I say to you” to introduce another teaching that related to the previous teaching.\n* When Jesus uses “amen” this way, some English versions (and the ULT) translate this as “verily” or “truly.”\n* Another word meaning “truly” is sometimes translated as “surely” or “certainly” and is also used to emphasize what the speaker is saying.\n\n## Translation Suggestions:\n\n* Consider whether the target language has a special word or phrase that is used to emphasize something that has been said.\n* When used at the end of a prayer or to confirm something, “amen” could be translated as “let it be so” or “may this happen” or “that is true.”\n* When Jesus says, “truly I tell you,” this could also be translated as “Yes, I tell you sincerely” or “That is true, and I also tell you.”\n* The phrase “truly, truly I tell you” could be translated as “I tell you this very sincerely” or “I tell you this very earnestly” or “what I am telling you is true.”\n\n(See also: [fulfill](../kt/fulfill.md), [true](../kt/true.md))\n\n## Bible References:\n\n* [Deuteronomy 27:15](rc://en/tn/help/deu/27/15)\n* [John 5:19](rc://en/tn/help/jhn/05/19)\n* [Jude 1:24-25](rc://en/tn/help/jud/01/24)\n* [Matthew 26:33-35](rc://en/tn/help/mat/26/33)\n* [Philemon 1:23-25](rc://en/tn/help/phm/01/23)\n* [Revelation 22:20-21](rc://en/tn/help/rev/22/20)\n\n## Word Data:\n\n* Strong’s: H0543, G02810\n",
      "angel": "# angel, archangel\n\n## Definition:\n\nAn angel is a powerful spirit being whom God created. Angels exist to serve God by doing whatever he tells them to do. The term “archangel” refers to the angel who rules or leads all the other angels.\n\n* The word “angel” literally means “messenger.”\n* The term “archangel” literally means “chief messenger.” The only angel referred to in the Bible as an “archangel” is Michael.\n* In the Bible, angels gave messages to people from God. These messages included instructions about what God wanted the people to do.\n* Angels also told people about events that were going to happen in the future or events that had already happened.\n* Angels have God’s authority as his representatives and sometimes in the Bible they spoke as if God himself was speaking.\n* Other ways that angels serve God are by protecting and strengthening people.\n* A special phrase, “angel of Yahweh,” has more than one possible meaning: (1) It may mean “angel who represents Yahweh” or “messenger who serves Yahweh.” (2) It may refer to Yahweh himself, who looked like an angel as he talked to a person. Either one of these meanings would explain the angel’s use of “I” as if Yahweh himself was talking.\n\n## Translation Suggestions:\n\n* Ways to translate “angel” could include “messenger from God” or “God’s heavenly servant” or “God’s spirit messenger.”\n* The term “archangel” could be translated as “chief angel” or “head ruling angel” or “leader of the angels.”\n* Also consider how these terms are translated in a national language or another local language.\n* The phrase “angel of Yahweh” should be translated using the words for “angel” and “Yahweh.” This will allow for different interpretations of that phrase. Possible translations could include “angel from Yahweh” or “angel sent by Yahweh” or “Yahweh, who looked like an angel.”\n\n(See also: [How to Translate Unknowns](rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown))\n\n(See also: [chief](../other/chief.md), [head](../other/head.md), [messenger](../other/messenger.md), [Michael](../names/michael.md), [ruler](../other/ruler.md), [servant](../other/servant.md))\n\n## Bible References:\n\n* [2 Samuel 24:16](rc://en/tn/help/2sa/24/16)\n* [Acts 10:3-6](rc://en/tn/help/act/10/03)\n* [Acts 12:23](rc://en/tn/help/act/12/23)\n* [Colossians 2:18-19](rc://en/tn/help/col/02/18)\n* [Genesis 48:16](rc://en/tn/help/gen/48/16)\n* [Luke 2:13](rc://en/tn/help/luk/02/13)\n* [Mark 8:38](rc://en/tn/help/mrk/08/38)\n* [Matthew 13:50](rc://en/tn/help/mat/13/50)\n* [Revelation 1:20](rc://en/tn/help/rev/01/20)\n* [Zechariah 1:9](rc://en/tn/help/zec/01/09)\n\n## Examples from the Bible stories:\n\n* __[2:12](rc://en/tn/help/obs/02/12)__ God placed large, powerful __angels__ at the entrance to the garden to keep anyone from eating the fruit of the tree of life.\n* __[22:3](rc://en/tn/help/obs/22/03)__ The __angel__ responded to Zechariah, “I was sent by God to bring you this good news.”\n* __[23:6](rc://en/tn/help/obs/23/06)__ Suddenly, a shining __angel__ appeared to them (the shepherds), and they were terrified.

This person or being will attempt to destroy God’s people, but he will be defeated by Jesus.\n* The apostle Paul refers to this person as “the man of lawlessness” (2 Thess 2:3) and to the general spirit of antichrist in the world as “the secret power of lawlessness” (2 Thess 2:7).\n\n## Translation Suggestions:\n\n* Other ways to translate this term could include a word or phrase that means “Christ-opposer” or “enemy of Christ” or “person who is against Christ.”\n* The phrase “spirit of the antichrist” could also be translated as “spirit that is against Christ” or “attitude of spreading lies about Christ” or “spirit that teaches lies about Christ.”\n* Also consider how this term is translated in a Bible translation in a local or national language.

      "circumcise": "# circumcise, circumcised, circumcision, uncircumcised, uncircumcision\n\n## Definition:\n\nThe term “circumcise” means to cut off the foreskin of a man or male child. A circumcision ceremony may be performed in connection with this.\n\n* God commanded Abraham to circumcise every male among his family and servants as a sign of God’s covenant with them.\n* God also commanded Abraham’s descendants to continue to do this for every baby boy born into their households.\n* The phrase, “circumcision of the heart” refers figuratively to the “cutting away” or removal of sin from a person.\n* In a spiritual sense, “the circumcised” refers to people whom God has purified from sin through the blood of Jesus and who are his people.\n* The term “uncircumcised” refers to those who have not been circumcised physically. It can also refer figuratively to those who have not been circumcised spiritually, who do not have a relationship with God.\n\nThe terms “uncircumcised” and “uncircumcision” refer to a male who has not been physically circumcised. These terms are also used figuratively.\n\n* Egypt was a nation that also required circumcision. So when God talks about Egypt being defeated by the “uncircumcised,” he is referring to people whom the Egyptians despised for not being circumcised.\n* The Bible refers to people who have an “uncircumcised heart” or who are “uncircumcised in heart.” This a figurative way of saying that these people are not God’s people, and are stubbornly disobedient to him.\n\n* If a word for circumcision is used or known in the language, “uncircumcised” could be translated as “not circumcised.”\n* The expression “the uncircumcision” could be translated as “people who are not circumcised” or “people who do not belong to God,” depending on the context.\n* Other ways to translate figurative senses of this term could include “not God’s people” or “rebellious like those who don’t belong to God” or “people who have no sign of belonging to God.”\n* The expression “uncircumcised in heart” could be translated as “stubbornly rebellious” or “refusing to believe.” However, if possible it is best to keep the expression or a similar one since spiritual circumcision is an important concept.\n\n## Translation Suggestions:\n\n* If the culture of the target language performs circumcisions on males, the word used to refer to this should be used for this term.\n* Other ways to translate this term would be, “cut around” or “cut in a circle” or “cut off the foreskin.”\n* In cultures where circumcision is not known, it may be necessary to explain it in a footnote or glossary.\n* Make sure the term used to translate this does not refer to females. It may be necessary to translate this with a word or phrase that includes the meaning of “male.”\n\n(See also: [How to Translate Unknowns](rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown))\n\n(See also: [Abraham](../names/abraham.md), [covenant](../kt/covenant.md))\n\n## Bible References:\n\n* [Genesis 17:11](rc://en/tn/help/gen/17/11)\n* [Genesis 17:14](rc://en/tn/help/gen/17/14)\n* [Exodus 12:48](rc://en/tn/help/exo/12/48)\n* [Leviticus 26:41](rc://en/tn/help/lev/26/41)\n* [Joshua 5:3](rc://en/tn/help/jos/05/03)\n* [Judges 15:18](rc://en/tn/help/jdg/15/18)\n* [2 Samuel 1:20](rc://en/tn/help/2sa/01/20)\n* [Jeremiah 9:26](rc://en/tn/help/jer/09/26)\n* [Ezekiel 32:25](rc://en/tn/help/ezk/32/25)\n* [Acts 10:44-45](rc://en/tn/help/act/10/44)\n* [Acts 11:3](rc://en/tn/help/act/11/03)\n* [Acts 15:1](rc://en/tn/help/act/15/01)\n* [Acts 11:3](rc://en/tn/help/act/11/03)\n* [Romans 2:27](rc://en/tn/help/rom/02/27)\n* [Galatians 5:3](rc://en/tn/help/gal/05/03)\n* [Ephesians 2:11](rc://en/tn/help/eph/02/11)\n* [Philippians 3:3](rc://en/tn/help/php/03/03)\n* [Colossians 2:11](rc://en/tn/help/col/02/11)\n* [Colossians 2:13](rc://en/tn/help/col/02/13)\n\n## Examples from the Bible stories:\n\n* __[5:3](rc://en/tn/help/obs/05/03)__ “You must __circumcise__ every male in your family.”\n* __[5:5](rc://en/tn/help/obs/05/05)__ That day Abraham __circumcised__ all the males in his household.\n\n## Word Data:\n\n* Strong’s: H4135, H4139, H5243, H6188, H6189, H6190, G02030, G05640, G19860, G40590, G40610\n",

The term “wash” refers specifically to action of removing dirt or stains from someone/something.\n\n* “Cleanse” is the process of making something “clean.” It could also be translated as “wash” or “purify.”\n* In the Old Testament, God told the Israelites which animals he had specified as ritually “clean” and which ones were “unclean.” Only the clean animals were permitted to be used for eating or for sacrifice. In this context, the term “clean” means that the animal was acceptable to God for use as a sacrifice.\n* A person who had certain skin diseases would be unclean until the skin was healed enough to no longer be contagious. Instructions for cleansing the skin had to be obeyed in order for that person to be declared “clean” again.\n* Sometimes “clean” is used figuratively to refer to moral purity, meaning to be “clean” from sin.\n\nIn the Bible, the term “unclean” is used figuratively to refer to things that God declared to be unfit for his people to touch, eat, or sacrifice.\n\n* God gave the Israelites instructions about which animals were “clean” and which ones were “unclean.” The unclean animals were not permitted to be used for eating or for sacrifice.\n* People with certain skin diseases were said to be “unclean” until they were healed.\n* If the Israelites touched something “unclean,” they themselves would be considered unclean for a certain period of time.\n* Obeying God’s commands about not touching or eating unclean things kept the Israelites set apart for God’s service.\n* This physical and ritual uncleanness was also symbolic of moral uncleanness.\n* In another figurative sense, an “unclean spirit” refers to an evil spirit.\n\n## Translation Suggestions:\n\n* This term could be translated with the common word for “clean” or “pure” (in the sense of being not dirty).\n* Other ways to translate this could include, “ritually clean” or “acceptable to God.”\n* “Cleanse” could be translated by “wash” or “purify.”\n* Make sure that the words used for “clean” and “cleanse” can also be understood in a figurative sense.\n\n* The term “unclean” could also be translated as “not clean” or “unfit in God’s eyes” or “physically unclean” or “defiled.”\n* When referring to a demon as an unclean spirit, “unclean” could be translated as “evil” or “defiled.”\n* The translation of this term should allow for spiritual uncleanness.

For example, when God established his covenant with mankind promising to never destroy the earth again with a worldwide flood, this promise had no conditions for people to fulfill.\n* In other covenants, God promised to fulfill his part only if the people obeyed him and fulfilled their part of the covenant.\n\nThe term “new covenant” refers to the commitment or agreement God made with his people through the sacrifice of his Son, Jesus.\n\n* God’s “new covenant” was explained in the part of the Bible called the “New Testament.”\n* This new covenant is in contrast to the “old” or “former” covenant that God had made with the Israelites in Old Testament times.\n* The new covenant is better than the old one because it is based on the sacrifice of Jesus, which completely atoned for people’s sins forever. The sacrifices made under the old covenant did not do this.\n* God writes the new covenant on the hearts those who become believers in Jesus. This causes them to want to obey God and to begin to live holy lives.\n* The new covenant will be completely fulfilled in the end times when God establishes his reign on earth. Everything will once again be very good, as it was when God first created the world.\n\n## Translation Suggestions:\n\n* Depending on the context, ways to translate this term could include, “binding agreement” or “formal commitment” or “pledge” or “contract.”\n* Some languages may have different words for covenant depending on whether one party or both parties have made a promise they must keep. If the covenant is one-sided, it could be translated as “promise” or “pledge.”\n* Make sure the translation of this term does not sound like people proposed the covenant. In all cases of covenants between God and people, it was God who initiated the covenant.\n\n* The term “new covenant” could be translated as “new formal agreement” or “new pact” or “new contract.”\n* The word “new” in these expressions has the meaning of “fresh” or “new kind of” or “another.”\n\n(See also: [covenant](../kt/covenant.md), [promise](../kt/promise.md))\n\n## Bible References:\n\n* [Genesis 9:12](rc://en/tn/help/gen/09/12)\n* [Genesis 17:7](rc://en/tn/help/gen/17/07)\n* [Genesis 31:44](rc://en/tn/help/gen/31/44)\n* [Exodus 34:10-11](rc://en/tn/help/exo/34/10)\n* [Joshua 24:24-26](rc://en/tn/help/jos/24/24)\n* [2 Samuel 23:5](rc://en/tn/help/2sa/23/5)\n* [2 Kings 18:11-12](rc://en/tn/help/2ki/18/11)\n* [Mark 14:24](rc://en/tn/help/mrk/14/24)\n* [Luke 1:73](rc://en/tn/help/luk/01/73)\n* [Luke 22:20](rc://en/tn/help/luk/22/20)\n* [Acts 7:8](rc://en/tn/help/act/07/08)\n* [1 Corinthians 11:25-26](rc://en/tn/help/1co/11/25)\n* [2 Corinthians 3:6](rc://en/tn/help/2co/03/06)\n* [Galatians 3:17-18](rc://en/tn/help/gal/03/17)\n* [Hebrews 12:24](rc://en/tn/help/heb/12/24)\n\n## Examples from the Bible stories:\n\n* __[4:9](rc://en/tn/help/obs/04/09)__ Then God made a __covenant__ with Abram.

They referred to anyone else as a “Gentile.”\n* Gentile could also be translated as “not a Jew” or “non-Jewish” or “not an Israelite” (Old Testament) or “non-Jew.”.\n* Traditionally, Jews would neither eat with nor associate with Gentiles, which at first caused problems within the early church.\n\n(See also: [Israel](../kt/israel.md), [Jacob](../names/jacob.md), [Jew](../kt/jew.md))\n\n## Bible References:\n\n* [Acts 9:13-16](rc://en/tn/help/act/09/13)\n* [Acts 14:5-7](rc://en/tn/help/act/14/05)\n* [Galatians 2:16](rc://en/tn/help/gal/02/16)\n* [Luke 2:32](rc://en/tn/help/luk/02/32)\n* [Matthew 5:47](rc://en/tn/help/mat/05/47)\n* [Matthew 6:5-7](rc://en/tn/help/mat/06/05)\n* [Romans 11:25](rc://en/tn/help/rom/11/25)\n\n## Word Data:\n\n* Strong’s: H1471, G14820, G14840, G16720\n",

The term “glorify” means to ascribe glory to someone or something, or to show or tell how glorious something or someone is.\n\n* In the Bible, the term “glory” is especially used to describe God, who is more valuable, more worthy, more important, more honorable, more splendid, and more majestic than anyone or anything in the universe. Everything about his character reveals his glory.\n* People can glorify God by telling about the wonderful things he has done. They can also glorify God by living in accordance with God’s character, because doing so shows to others his value, worth, importance, honor, splendor, and majesty.\n* The expression to “glory in” means to boast about or take pride in something.\n\n### Old Testament\n\n* The specific phrase “the glory of Yahweh” in the Old Testament usually refers to some perceptible manifestation of Yahweh’s presence in a particular location.\n\n### New Testament\n\n* God the Father will glorify God the Son by revealing to all people the full extent of how glorious Jesus is.\n* Everyone who believes in Christ will be glorified with him. This use of the term “glorify” carries a unique meaning. It means that when people who believe in Christ are raised to life, they will be changed physically to be like Jesus as he appeared after his resurrection.\n\n## Translation Suggestions:\n\n* Depending on the context, different ways to translate “glory” could include “splendor” or “majesty” or “awesome greatness” or “extreme value.”\n* The term “glorious” could be translated as “full of glory” or “extremely valuable” or “brightly shining” or “awesomely majestic.”\n* The expression “give glory to God” could be translated as “honor God’s greatness” or “praise God because of his splendor” or “tell others how great God is.”\n* The expression “glory in” could also be translated as “praise” or “take pride in” or “boast about” or “take pleasure in.”\n* “Glorify” could also be translated as “give glory to” or “bring glory to” or “cause to appear great.”\n* The phrase “glorify God” could also be translated as “praise God” or “talk about God’s greatness” or “show how great God is” or “honor God (by obeying him).”\n* The term “be glorified” could also be translated as “be shown to be very great” or “be praised” or “be exalted.”\n\n(See also: [honor](../kt/honor.md), [majesty](../kt/majesty.md), [exalt](../kt/exalt.md), [obey](../other/obey.md), [praise](../other/praise.md))\n\n## Bible References:\n\n* [Exodus 24:17](rc://en/tn/help/exo/24/17)\n* [Numbers 14:9-10](rc://en/tn/help/num/14/09)\n* [Isaiah 35:2](rc://en/tn/help/isa/35/02)\n* [Luke 18:43](rc://en/tn/help/luk/18/43)\n* [Luke 2:9](rc://en/tn/help/luk/02/09)\n* [John 12:28](rc://en/tn/help/jhn/12/28)\n* [Acts 3:13-14](rc://en/tn/help/act/03/13)\n* [Acts 7:1-3](rc://en/tn/help/act/07/01)\n* [Romans 8:17](rc://en/tn/help/rom/08/17)\n* [1 Corinthians 6:19-20](rc://en/tn/help/1co/06/19)\n* [Philippians 2:14-16](rc://en/tn/help/php/02/14)\n* [Philippians 4:19](rc://en/tn/help/php/04/19)\n* [Colossians 3:1-4](rc://en/tn/help/col/03/01)\n* [1 Thessalonians 2:5](rc://en/tn/help/1th/02/05)\n* [James 2:1-4](rc://en/tn/help/jas/02/01)\n* [1 Peter 4:15-16](rc://en/tn/help/1pe/04/15)\n* [Revelation 15:4](rc://en/tn/help/rev/15/04)\n\n## Examples from the Bible stories:\n\n* __[23:7](rc://en/tn/help/obs/23/07)__ Suddenly, the skies were filled with angels praising God, saying, “__Glory__ to God in heaven and peace on earth to the people he favors!”\n* __[25:6](rc://en/tn/help/obs/25/06)__ Then Satan showed Jesus all the kingdoms of the world and all their __glory__ and said, “I will give you all this if you bow down and worship me.”\n* __[37:1](rc://en/tn/help/obs/37/01)__ When Jesus heard this news, he said, “This sickness will not end in death, but it is for the __glory__ of God.”\n* __[37:8](rc://en/tn/help/obs/37/08)__ Jesus responded, “Did I not tell you that you would see God’s __glory__ if you believe in me?”\n\n## Word Data:\n\n* Strong’s: H0117, H0142, H0155, H0215, H1342, H1921, H1926, H1935, H1984, H3367, H3513, H3519, H3520, H6286, H6643, H7623, H8597, G13910, G13920, G17400, G17410, G27440, G48880\n",
      "god": "# God\n\n## Definition:\n\nIn the Bible, the term “God” refers to the eternal being who created the universe out of nothing. God exists as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. God’s personal name is “Yahweh.”\n\n* God has always existed; he existed before anything else existed, and he will continue to exist forever.\n* He is the only true God and has authority over everything in the universe.\n* God is perfectly righteous, infinitely wise, holy, sinless, just, merciful, and loving.\n* He is a covenant-keeping God, who always fulfills his promises.\n* People were created to worship God and he is the only one they should worship.\n* God revealed his name as “Yahweh,” which means “he is” or “I am” or “the One who (always) exists.”\n* The Bible also teaches about false “gods,” which are nonliving idols that people wrongly worship.\n\n## Translation Suggestions:\n\n* Ways to translate “God” could include “Deity” or “Creator” or “Supreme Being” or “Supreme Creator” or “Infinite Sovereign Lord” or “Eternal Supreme Being.”\n* Consider how God is referred to in a local or national language. There may also already be a word for “God” in the language being translated. If so, it is important to make sure that this word fits the characteristics of the one true God as described above.\n* Many languages capitalize the first letter of the word for the one true God, to distinguish it from the word for a false god. Another way to make this distinction would be to use different terms for “God” and “god.” NOTE: In the biblical text, when a person who does not worship Yahweh speaks about Yahweh and uses the word “god,” it is acceptable to render the term without a capital letter in reference to Yahweh (see Jonah 1:6, 3:9).\n* The phrase “I will be their God and they will be my people” could also be translated as “I, God, will rule over these people and they will worship me.”\n\n(Translation suggestions: [How to Translate Names](rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names))\n\n(See also: [create](../other/creation.md), [false god](../kt/falsegod.md), [God the Father](../kt/godthefather.md), [Holy Spirit](../kt/holyspirit.md), [false god](../kt/falsegod.md), [Son of God](../kt/sonofgod.md), [Yahweh](../kt/yahweh.md))\n\n## Bible References:\n\n* [1 John 1:7](rc://en/tn/help/1jn/01/07)\n* [1 Samuel 10:7-8](rc://en/tn/help/1sa/10/07)\n* [1 Timothy 4:10](rc://en/tn/help/1ti/04/10)\n* [Colossians 1:16](rc://en/tn/help/col/01/16)\n* [Deuteronomy 29:14-16](rc://en/tn/help/deu/29/14)\n* [Ezra 3:1-2](rc://en/tn/help/ezr/03/01)\n* [Genesis 1:2](rc://en/tn/help/gen/01/02)\n* [Hosea 4:11-12](rc://en/tn/help/hos/04/11)\n* [Isaiah 36:6-7](rc://en/tn/help/isa/36/06)\n* [James 2:20](rc://en/tn/help/jas/02/20)\n* [Jeremiah 5:5](rc://en/tn/help/jer/05/05)\n* [John 1:3](rc://en/tn/help/jhn/01/03)\n* [Joshua 3:9-11](rc://en/tn/help/jos/03/09)\n* [Lamentations 3:43](rc://en/tn/help/lam/03/43)\n* [Micah 4:5](rc://en/tn/help/mic/04/05)\n* [Philippians 2:6](rc://en/tn/help/php/02/06)\n* [Proverbs 24:12](rc://en/tn/help/pro/24/12)\n* [Psalms 47:9](rc://en/tn/help/psa/047/09)\n\n## Examples from the Bible stories:\n\n* __[1:1](rc://en/tn/help/obs/01/01)__ __God__ created the universe and everything in it in six days.\n* __[1:15](rc://en/tn/help/obs/01/15)__ __God__ made man and woman in his own image.\n* __[5:3](rc://en/tn/help/obs/05/03)__ “I am __God__ Almighty.

      "hades": "# Hades, Sheol\n\n## Definition:\n\nThe terms “Hades” (in Greek) and “Sheol” (in Hebrew) are proper names for the place where the spirits of dead people would go after they had died. \n\n* In these ancient cultures, people thought of this as an underground dwelling place where the spirits of dead people existed in a shadowy, semi-conscious form.\n* Although these terms are place names, in the Bible they often mean the same thing as \"death\" or \"the grave.\"\n* Throughout most of biblical history, “Sheol” and “Hades” refer to a neutral place where all of the dead go to await judgment, both the righteous and the unrighteous. In the New Testament, however, “Hades” begins to be seen as a place for only the unrighteous, in contrast with “Abraham's side” (Luke 16:22) or “paradise” (Luke 23:43), which describe the place for the righteous. \n\n## Translation Suggestions\n\n* Both “Sheol” and “Hades” can be translated in various ways, depending on the context. Some possibilities include: “place of the dead,” “place for dead spirits,” “the underworld,” “the pit,” “the grave,” or “death.”\n* Some translations keep the proper names “Sheol” and “Hades,” spelling them to fit the sound patterns of the language of translation. (See: [How to Translate Unknowns](rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown)).\n* A phrase could also be added to each term to explain it.

      "highpriest": "# high priest, chief priests\n\n## Definition:\n\nThe term “high priest” refers to a special priest who was appointed to serve for one year as the leader of all of the other Israelite priests. In New Testament times, some other priests were also considered very important Jewish religious leaders, with authority over other priests and the people. These were the chief priests.\n\n* The high priest had special responsibilities. He was the only one who was permitted to go into the most holy part of the tabernacle or the temple to offer a special sacrifice once per year.\n* The Israelites had many priests, but only one high priest at a time.\n* After high priests retired, they still kept the title, along with some of the responsibilities of the office.

      "iamyahweh": "# I am Yahweh\n\n## Facts:\n\nThe statement “I am Yahweh” is used to mark out a command, historical event, promise, or prophecy as something that is particularly important, as something that happened by Yahweh’s power, or as something that will happen regardless of circumstances. This certainty is based on Yahweh’s character and strength as the all-powerful ruler over all things. At the same time, the statement is used to give Yahweh’s people understanding of who he is and what his name means. By reflecting on the command, historical event, promise, or prophecy so marked, the listener will understand more of who Yahweh is. [Leviticus 11:44–45](rc://en/tn/help/lev/11/44) makes it clear that by adhering to the holiness laws that follow, the people will become holy like Yahweh. There are four primary ways or forms in which this statement occurs:\n\n1. As “I am Yahweh” or “I am Yahweh your God”\n\n2. As the statement “[someone] will know that I am Yahweh” (often followed by “when [I do something]”). This is the most common use.\n\n3. Followed by an example of what he is going to do or has done that validates his character and power\n\n4. Followed by an attribute\n\nThese uses can be combined, such as in [Leviticus 19:2](rc://en/tn/help/lev/19/02), [19:36](rc://en/tn/help/lev/19/36), and [20:24](rc://en/tn/help/lev/20/24).\n\n## Translation Suggestions:\n\n* As much as possible, translate this statement fairly literally. This will probably not be difficult for the second and third forms above.\n* [Ezekiel 20:5](rc://en/tn/help/ezk/20/05) and [Hebrews 6:13](rc://en/tn/help/heb/06/13) indicate that in at least some instances ([Genesis 28:13](rc://en/tn/help/gen/28/13), [Exodus 6:2](rc://en/tn/help/exo/06/02), [6:6](rc://en/tn/help/exo/06/06), [6:8](rc://en/tn/help/exo/06/08), etc.), “I am Yahweh” should be viewed as an oath formula. In these instances (primarily form one above) you may need to include an explanatory comment in your translation.\n  * If Yahweh is making a promise, you may need to make this explicit, using an example such as: “I am Yahweh who swears to you.”\n  * In Leviticus especially, the statement appears connected to many commands and you may need to make this explicit with a statement, such as: “I am Yahweh who commands this.” You could also use a slightly longer statement, such as: “I am Yahweh, and I bind you to this with an oath.” However, a statement this long may be tedious, so you could consider only using it the first (and possibly the last) time that “I am Yahweh” occurs in a series.\n* Some languages will use “the Lord” in place of Yahweh; see [Yahweh](../kt/yahweh.md) for more.\n\n(See also: [Lord](../kt/lord.md), [Lord Yahweh](../kt/lordyahweh.md), [Yahweh](../kt/yahweh.md))\n\n## Bible References:\n\n1.

The phrase “image of God” is used in different ways, depending on the context.\n\n* At the beginning of time, God created human beings “in his image,” that is, “in his likeness.” This means that people have certain characteristics that reflect the image of God, such as the ability to feel emotion, the ability to reason and communicate, and a spirit that lives eternally.\n* The Bible teaches that Jesus, God’s Son, is “the image of God,” that is, he is God himself. Unlike human beings, Jesus was not created. From all eternity God the Son has had all the divine characteristics because he has had the same essence with God the Father.\n\n## Translation Suggestions:\n\n* When referring to Jesus, “image of God” could be translated as “exact likeness of God” or “same essence as God” or “same being as God.”\n* When referring to human beings, “God created them in his image” could be translated with a phrase that means “God created them to be like him” or “God created them with characteristics like his own.”\n\n(See also: [image](../other/image.md), [Son of God](../kt/sonofgod.md), [Son of God](../kt/sonofgod.md))\n\n## Bible References:\n\n* [2 Corinthians 4:3-4](rc://en/tn/help/2co/04/03)\n* [Colossians 3:9-11](rc://en/tn/help/col/03/09)\n* [Genesis 1:26-27](rc://en/tn/help/gen/01/26)\n* [Genesis 9:6](rc://en/tn/help/gen/09/06)\n* [James 3:9-10](rc://en/tn/help/jas/03/09)\n* [Romans 8:28-30](rc://en/tn/help/rom/08/28)\n\n## Word Data:\n\n* Strong’s: H4541, H1544, H2553, H6456, H6459, H6754, H6816, H8403, G05040, G01790\n",
      "inchrist": "# in Christ, in Jesus, in the Lord, in him\n\n## Definition:\n\nThe phrase “in Christ” and related terms refer to the state or condition of being in relationship with Jesus Christ through faith in him.\n\n* Other related terms include “in Christ Jesus, in Jesus Christ, in the Lord Jesus, in the Lord Jesus Christ.”\n* Possible meanings for the term “in Christ” could include “because you belong to Christ” or “through the relationship you have with Christ” or “based on your faith in Christ.”\n* These related terms all have the same meaning of being in a state of believing in Jesus and being his disciple.\n* Note: Sometimes the word “in” belongs with the verb. For example, “share in Christ” means to “share in” the benefits that come from knowing Christ. To “glory in” Christ means to be glad and give praise to God for who Jesus is and what he has done. To “believe in” Christ means to trust him as Savior and know him.\n\n## Translation Suggestions:\n\n* Depending on the context, different ways to translate “in Christ” and “in the Lord” (and related phrases) could include:\n\n    * “who belong to Christ”\n    * “because you believe in Christ”\n    * “because Christ has saved us”\n    * “in service to the Lord”\n    * “relying on the Lord”\n    * “because of what the Lord has done.”\n\n* People who “believe in” Christ or who “have faith in” Christ believe what Jesus taught and are trusting him to save them because of his sacrifice on the cross that paid the penalty for their sins.

Jesus, the Son of God, is the Messiah who will rule over God’s kingdom forever.\n\n## Translation Suggestions:\n\n* Depending on the context, “kingdom of God” can be translated as “God’s rule (as king)” or “when God reigns as king” or “God’s rule over everything.”\n* Depending on the context, the term “kingdom of heaven” could also be translated as “God’s rule from heaven as king” or “God in heaven reigning” or “heaven’s reign” or “heaven ruling over everything.” If it is not possible to translate this simply and clearly, the phrase “kingdom of God” could be translated instead.\n* Some translators may prefer to capitalize “Heaven” to show that it refers to God. Others may include a note in the text, such as “kingdom of heaven (that is, ‘kingdom of God’).”\n* A footnote at the bottom of the page of a printed Bible may also be used to explain the meaning of “heaven” in this expression.\n\n(See also: [God](../kt/god.md), [heaven](../kt/heaven.md), [king](../other/king.md), [kingdom](../other/kingdom.md), [King of the Jews](../kt/kingofthejews.md), [reign](../other/reign.md))\n\n## Bible References:\n\n* [2 Thessalonians 1:5](rc://en/tn/help/2th/01/05)\n* [Acts 8:12-13](rc://en/tn/help/act/08/12)\n* [Acts 28:23](rc://en/tn/help/act/28/23)\n* [Colossians 4:11](rc://en/tn/help/col/04/11)\n* [John 3:3](rc://en/tn/help/jhn/03/03)\n* [Luke 7:28](rc://en/tn/help/luk/07/28)\n* [Luke 10:9](rc://en/tn/help/luk/10/09)\n* [Luke 12:31-32](rc://en/tn/help/luk/12/31)\n* [Matthew 3:2](rc://en/tn/help/mat/03/02)\n* [Matthew 4:17](rc://en/tn/help/mat/04/17)\n* [Matthew 5:10](rc://en/tn/help/mat/05/10)\n* [Romans 14:17](rc://en/tn/help/rom/14/17)\n\n## Examples from the Bible stories:\n\n* __[24:2](rc://en/tn/help/obs/24/02)__ He (John) preached to them, saying, “Repent, for the __kingdom of God__ is near!”\n* __[28:6](rc://en/tn/help/obs/28/06)__ Then Jesus said to his disciples, “It is extremely hard for rich people to enter into the __kingdom of God__!

      "lord": "# lord, Lord, master, sir\n\n## Definition:\n\nIn the Bible, the term “lord” generally refers to someone who has ownership or authority over other people. In the Bible, however, the term is used to address many different kinds of people, including God.\n\n* This word is sometimes translated as “master” when addressing Jesus or when referring to someone who owns slaves.\n* Some English versions translate this as “sir” in contexts where someone is politely addressing someone of higher status.\n\nWhen “Lord” is capitalized, it is a title that refers to God. (Note, however, that when it is used as a form of addressing someone or it occurs at the beginning of a sentence it may be capitalized and have the meaning of “sir” or “master.”)\n\n* In the Old Testament, this term is also used in expressions such as “Lord God Almighty” or “Lord Yahweh” or “Yahweh our Lord.”\n* In the New Testament, the apostles used this term in expressions such as “Lord Jesus” and “Lord Jesus Christ,” which communicate that Jesus is God.\n* The term “Lord” in the New Testament is also used alone as a direct reference to God, especially in quotations from the Old Testament. For example, the Old Testament text has “Blessed is he who comes in the name of Yahweh” and the New Testament text has “Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.”\n* In the ULT and UST, the title “Lord” is only used to translate the actual Hebrew and Greek words that mean “Lord.” It is never used as a translation of God’s name (Yahweh), as is done in many translations.\n\n* Some languages translate “Lord” as “Master” or “Ruler” or some other term that communicates ownership or supreme rule.\n* In the appropriate contexts, many translations capitalize the first letter of this term to make it clear to the reader that this is a title referring to God.\n* For places in the New Testament where there is a quote from the Old Testament, the term “Lord God” could be used to make it clear that this is a reference to God.\n\n## Translation Suggestions:\n\n* This term can be translated with the equivalent of “master” when it refers to a person who owns slaves. It can also be used by a servant to address the person he works for.\n* When it refers to Jesus, if the context shows that the speaker sees him as a religious teacher, it can be translated with a respectful address for a religious teacher, such as “master.”\n* If the person addressing Jesus does not know him, “lord” could be translated with a respectful form of address such as “sir.” This translation would also be used for other contexts in which a polite form of address to a man is called for.\n* When referring to God the Father or to Jesus, this term is considered a title, written as “Lord” (capitalized) in English.\n\n(See also: [God](../kt/god.md), [Jesus](../kt/jesus.md), [ruler](../other/ruler.md), [Yahweh](../kt/yahweh.md))\n\n## Bible References:\n\n* [Genesis 39:2](rc://en/tn/help/gen/39/02)\n* [Joshua 3:9-11](rc://en/tn/help/jos/03/09)\n* [Psalms 86:15-17](rc://en/tn/help/psa/086/015)\n* [Jeremiah 27:4](rc://en/tn/help/jer/27/04)\n* [Lamentations 2:2](rc://en/tn/help/lam/02/02)\n* [Ezekiel 18:29](rc://en/tn/help/ezk/18/29)\n* [Daniel 9:9](rc://en/tn/help/dan/09/09)\n* [Daniel 9:17-19](rc://en/tn/help/dan/09/17)\n* [Malachi 3:1](rc://en/tn/help/mal/03/01)\n* [Matthew 7:21-23](rc://en/tn/help/mat/07/21)\n* [Luke 1:30-33](rc://en/tn/help/luk/01/30)\n* [Luke 16:13](rc://en/tn/help/luk/16/13)\n* [Romans 6:23](rc://en/tn/help/rom/06/23)\n* [Ephesians 6:9](rc://en/tn/help/eph/06/9)\n* [Philippians 2:9-11](rc://en/tn/help/php/02/09)\n* [Colossians 3:23](rc://en/tn/help/col/03/23)\n* [Hebrews 12:14](rc://en/tn/help/heb/12/14)\n* [James 2:1](rc://en/tn/help/jas/02/01)\n* [1 Peter 1:3](rc://en/tn/help/1pe/01/03)\n* [Jude 1:5](rc://en/tn/help/jud/01/05)\n* [Revelation 15:4](rc://en/tn/help/rev/15/04)\n\n## Examples from the Bible stories:\n\n* __[25:5](rc://en/tn/help/obs/25/05)__ But Jesus replied to Satan by quoting from the Scriptures.

Also consider how the term “Lord” is translated in other contexts when referring to God.\n* Some languages put titles after the name and would translate this as “Yahweh Lord.” Consider what is natural in the project language: should the title “Lord” come before or after “Yahweh”?\n* “Yahweh God” could also be rendered as “God who is called Yahweh” or “God who is the Living One” or “I am, who is God.”\n* If the translation follows the tradition of rendering “Yahweh” as “Lord” or “LORD,” the term “Lord Yahweh” could be translated as “Lord God” or “God who is the Lord.” Other possible translations could be, “Master LORD” or “God the LORD.”\n* The term “Lord Yahweh” _should not_ be rendered as “Lord LORD” because readers may not notice the difference in letter size that has traditionally been used to distinguish these two words and it would look very strange.\n\n(Translation suggestions: [How to Translate Names](rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names))\n\n(See also: [God](../kt/god.md), [lord](../kt/lord.md), [Lord](../kt/lord.md), [Yahweh](../kt/yahweh.md))\n\n## Bible References:\n\n* [1 Corinthians 4:3-4](rc://en/tn/help/1co/04/03)\n* [2 Samuel 7:21-23](rc://en/tn/help/2sa/07/21)\n* [Deuteronomy 3:23-25](rc://en/tn/help/deu/03/23)\n* [Ezekiel 39:25-27](rc://en/tn/help/ezk/39/25)\n* [Ezekiel 45:18](rc://en/tn/help/ezk/45/18)\n* [Jeremiah 44:26](rc://en/tn/help/jer/44/26)\n* [Judges 6:22](rc://en/tn/help/jdg/06/22)\n* [Micah 1:2-4](rc://en/tn/help/mic/01/02)\n\n## Word Data:\n\n* Strong’s: H0136, H0430, H3068, G23160, G29620\n",
      "love": "# love, beloved\n\n## Definition:\n\nTo love another person is to care for that person and do things that will benefit him. There are different meanings for “love” some languages may express using different words:\n\n1. The kind of love that comes from God is focused on the good of others even when it doesn’t benefit oneself. This kind of love cares for others, no matter what they do. God himself is love and is the source of true love.\n\n    * Jesus showed this kind of love by sacrificing his life in order to rescue us from sin and death. He also taught his followers to love others sacrificially.\n    * When people love others with this kind of love, they act in ways that show they are thinking of what will cause the others to thrive. This kind of love especially includes forgiving others.\n    * In the ULT, the word “love” refers to this kind of sacrificial love, unless a Translation Note indicates a different meaning.\n\n2. Another word in the New Testament refers to brotherly love, or love for a friend or family member.\n\n    * This term refers to natural human love between friends or relatives.\n    * The term can also be used in such contexts as, “They love to sit in the most important seats at a banquet.” This means that they “like very much” or “greatly desire” to do that.\n\n3. The word “love” can also refer to romantic love between a man and a woman.\n\n## Translation Suggestions:\n\n* Unless indicated otherwise in a Translation Note, the word “love” in the ULT refers to the kind of sacrificial love that comes from God.\n* Some languages may have a special word for the kind of unselfish, sacrificial love that God has. Ways to translate this might include, “devoted, faithful caring” or “care for unselfishly” or “love from God.” Make sure that the word used to translate God’s love can include giving up one’s own interests to benefit others and loving others no matter what they do.\n* Sometimes the English word “love” describes the deep caring that people have for friends and family members. Some languages might translate this with a word or phrase that means “like very much” or “care for” or “have strong affection for.”\n* In contexts where the word “love” is used to express a strong preference for something, this could be translated by “strongly prefer” or “like very much” or “greatly desire.”\n* Some languages may also have a separate word that refers to romantic or sexual love between a husband and wife.\n* Many languages must express “love” as an action. So for example, they might translate “love is patient, love is kind” as, “when a person loves someone, he is patient with him and kind to him.”\n\n(See also: [covenant](../kt/covenant.md), [death](../other/death.md), [sacrifice](../other/sacrifice.md), [save](../kt/save.md), [sin](../kt/sin.md))\n\n## Bible References:\n\n* [1 Corinthians 13:7](rc://en/tn/help/1co/13/07)\n* [1 John 3:2](rc://en/tn/help/1jn/03/02)\n* [1 Thessalonians 4:10](rc://en/tn/help/1th/04/10)\n* [Galatians 5:23](rc://en/tn/help/gal/05/23)\n* [Genesis 29:18](rc://en/tn/help/gen/29/18)\n* [Isaiah 56:6](rc://en/tn/help/isa/56/06)\n* [Jeremiah 2:2](rc://en/tn/help/jer/02/02)\n* [John 3:16](rc://en/tn/help/jhn/03/16)\n* [Matthew 10:37](rc://en/tn/help/mat/10/37)\n* [Nehemiah 9:32-34](rc://en/tn/help/neh/09/32)\n* [Philippians 1:9](rc://en/tn/help/php/01/09)\n* [Song of Songs 1:2](rc://en/tn/help/sng/01/02)\n\n## Examples from the Bible stories:\n\n* __[27:2](rc://en/tn/help/obs/27/02)__ The law expert replied that God’s law says, “__Love__ the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, strength, and mind.

However, because all people have sinned, no one except God is completely righteous.\n* Examples of people the Bible who were called “righteous” include Noah, Job, Abraham, Zachariah, and Elisabeth.\n* When people trust in Jesus to save them, God cleanses them from their sins and declares them to be righteous because of Jesus’ righteousness.\n\nThe term “unrighteous” means to be sinful and morally corrupt. “Unrighteousness” refers to sin or the condition of being sinful.\n\n* These terms especially refer to living in a way that disobeys God’s teachings and commands.\n* Unrighteous people are immoral in their thoughts and actions.\n* Sometimes “the unrighteous” refers specifically to people who do not believe in Jesus.\n\nThe terms “upright” and “uprightness” refer to acting in a way that follows God’s laws.\n\n* The meaning of these words includes the idea of standing up straight and looking directly ahead.\n* A person who is “upright” is someone who obeys God’s rules and does not do things that are against his will.\n* Terms such as “integrity” and “righteous” have similar meanings and are sometimes used in parallelism constructions, such as “integrity and uprightness.” (See: [parallelism](rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism))\n\n## Translation Suggestions:\n\n* When it describes God, the term “righteous” could be translated as “perfectly good and just” or “always acting rightly.”\n* God’s “righteousness” could also be translated as “perfect faithfulness and goodness.”\n* When it describes people who are obedient to God, the term “righteous” could also be translated as “morally good” or “just” or “living a God-pleasing life.”\n* The phrase “the righteous” could also be translated as “righteous people” or “God-fearing people.”\n* Depending on the context, “righteousness” could also be translated with a word or phrase that means “goodness” or “being perfect before God” or “acting in a right way by obeying God” or “doing perfectly good.”\n\n* The term “unrighteous” could simply be translated as “not righteous.”\n* Depending on the context, other ways to translate this could include “wicked” or “immoral” or “people who rebel against God” or “sinful.”\n* The phrase “the unrighteous” could be translated as “unrighteous people.”\n* The term “unrighteousness” could be translated as “sin” or “evil thoughts and actions” or “wickedness.”\n* If possible, it is best to translate this in a way that shows its relationship to “righteous, righteousness.”\n\n* Ways to translate “upright” could include “acting rightly” or “one who acts rightly” or “following God’s laws” or “obedient to God” or “behaving in a way that is right.”\n* The term “uprightness” could be translated as “moral purity” or “good moral conduct” or “rightness.”\n* The phrase “the upright” could be translated as “people who are upright” or “upright people.”\n\n(See also: [evil](../kt/evil.md), [faithful](../kt/faithful.md), [good](../kt/good.md), [holy](../kt/holy.md), [integrity](../other/integrity.md), [just](../kt/justice.md), [law](../other/law.md), [law](../kt/lawofmoses.md), [obey](../other/obey.md), [pure](../kt/purify.md), [righteous](../kt/righteous.md), [sin](../kt/sin.md), [unlawful](../other/lawful.md))\n\n## Bible References:\n\n* [Deuteronomy 19:16](rc://en/tn/help/deu/19/16)\n* [Job 1:8](rc://en/tn/help/job/01/08)\n* [Psalms 37:30](rc://en/tn/help/psa/037/30)\n* [Psalms 49:14](rc://en/tn/help/psa/049/14)\n* [Psalms 107:42](rc://en/tn/help/psa/107/42)\n* [Ecclesiastes 12:10-11](rc://en/tn/help/ecc/12/10)\n* [Isaiah 48:1-2](rc://en/tn/help/isa/48/01)\n* [Ezekiel 33:13](rc://en/tn/help/ezk/33/13)\n* [Malachi 2:6](rc://en/tn/help/mal/02/06)\n* [Matthew 6:1](rc://en/tn/help/mat/06/01)\n* [Acts 3:13-14](rc://en/tn/help/act/03/13)\n* [Romans 1:29-31](rc://en/tn/help/rom/01/29)\n* [1 Corinthians 6:9](rc://en/tn/help/1co/06/09)\n* [Galatians 3:7](rc://en/tn/help/gal/03/07)\n* [Colossians 3:25](rc://en/tn/help/col/03/25)\n* [2 Thessalonians 2:10](rc://en/tn/help/2th/02/10)\n* [2 Timothy 3:16](rc://en/tn/help/2ti/03/16)\n* [1 Peter 3:18-20](rc://en/tn/help/1pe/03/18)\n* [1 John 1:9](rc://en/tn/help/1jn/01/09)\n* [1 John 5:16-17](rc://en/tn/help/1jn/05/16)\n\n## Examples from the Bible stories:\n\n* __[3:2](rc://en/tn/help/obs/03/02)__ But Noah found favor with God.

It can also refer to someone who gives strength to others or provides for them.\n\n* In the Old Testament, God is referred to as Israel’s Savior because he often rescued them from their enemies, gave them strength, and provided them with what they needed to live.\n* In the Old Testament, God appointed judges to protect the Israelites by leading them in battle against other people groups who came to attack them. These judges are sometimes called “saviors.” The Old Testament book of Judges records the time in history when these judges were governing Israel.\n* In the New Testament, “Savior” is used as a description or title for Jesus Christ because he saves people from being eternally punished for their sin. He also saves them from being controlled by their sin.\n\n## Translation Suggestions:\n\n* If possible, “Savior” should be translated with a word that is related to the words “save” and “salvation.”\n* Ways to translate this term could include “the One who saves” or “God, who saves” or “who delivers from danger” or “who rescues from enemies” or “Jesus, the one who rescues (people) from sin.”\n\n(See also: [deliver](../other/deliverer.md), [Jesus](../kt/jesus.md), [save](../kt/save.md), [save](../kt/save.md))\n\n## Bible References:\n\n* [1 Timothy 4:10](rc://en/tn/help/1ti/04/10)\n* [2 Peter 2:20](rc://en/tn/help/2pe/02/20)\n* [Acts 5:29-32](rc://en/tn/help/act/05/29)\n* [Isaiah 60:15-16](rc://en/tn/help/isa/60/15)\n* [Luke 1:47](rc://en/tn/help/luk/01/47)\n* [Psalms 106:19-21](rc://en/tn/help/psa/106/019)\n\n## Word Data:\n\n* Strong’s: H3467, G49900\n",

      "shaddai": "# shaddai\n\n## Facts:\n\nThe term “Shaddai” is a Hebrew word used for deity. It is used in the Old Testament as a personal name for God. The specific origin (and therefore meaning) of this term is not known. Scholars have proposed different possibilites for what it means and the most probable is that “shaddai” means “mountain” or “mountain range.” \n\n* The Hebrew word “Shaddai” is often translated into English as “the Almighty.” \n* The Hebrew phrase “El Shaddai” is often translated into English as “God Almighty.”\n* If “Shaddai” means “mountain” or “mountain range” then the Hebrew phrase \"El Shaddai\" literally means “God, the one of the mountain.”\n* The ULT and UST texts always translate this term as, “Shaddai,” in agreement with the Hebrew text of the Old Testament.\n\n## Translation Suggestions:\n\n* Even though the word Shaddai is a name for a God it is often translated as a title or description, “the Almighty,” rather than as a name. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to translate the word in the same way that it does. If a translation does not exist, you may wish to use the name Shaddai.\n* If you choose to translate the term “Shaddai” as a name you could spell it the way it sounds in your language and you could also spell the phrase “El Shaddai” the way it sounds in your language.\n\n(Translation suggestions: [How to Translate Names](rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names))\n\n(See also: [God](../kt/god.md))\n\n## Bible References:\n\n\n\n## Examples from the Bible stories:\n\n\n## Word Data:\n\n* Strong’s:\n",

Sin can also refer to not doing something that God wants us to do.\n\n* Sin includes anything we do that does not obey or please God, even things that other people don’t know about.\n* Thoughts and actions that disobey God’s will are called “sinful.”\n* Because Adam sinned, all human beings are born with a “sinful nature,” a nature that that controls them and causes them to sin.\n* A “sinner” is someone who sins, so every human being is a sinner.\n* Sometimes the word “sinners” was used by religious people like the Pharisees to refer to people who didn’t keep the law as well as the Pharisees thought they should.\n* The term “sinner” was also used for people who were considered to be worse sinners than other people. For example, this label was given to tax collectors and prostitutes.\n\n## Translation Suggestions:\n\n* The term “sin” could be translated with a word or phrase that means “disobedience to God” or “going against God’s will” or “evil behavior and thoughts” or “wrongdoing.”\n* To “sin” could also be translated as to “disobey God” or to “do wrong.”\n* Depending on the context “sinful” could be translated as “full of wrongdoing” or “wicked” or “immoral” or “evil” or “rebelling against God.”\n* Depending on the context the term “sinner” could be translated with a word or phrase that means “person who sins” or “person who does wrong things” or “person who disobeys God” or “person who disobeys the law.”\n* The term “sinners” could be translated by a word or phrase that means “very sinful people” or “people considered to be very sinful” or “immoral people.”\n* Ways to translate “tax collectors and sinners” could include “people who collect money for the government, and other very sinful people” or “very sinful people, including (even) tax collectors.”\n* Make sure the translation of this term can include sinful behavior and thoughts, even those that other people don’t see or know about.\n* The term “sin” should be general, and different from the terms for “wickedness” and “evil.”\n\n(See also: [disobey](../other/disobey.md), [evil](../kt/evil.md), [flesh](../kt/flesh.md), [tax collector](../other/tax.md))\n\n## Bible References:\n\n* [1 Chronicles 9:1-3](rc://en/tn/help/1ch/09/01)\n* [1 John 1:10](rc://en/tn/help/1jn/01/10)\n* [1 John 2:2](rc://en/tn/help/1jn/02/02)\n* [2 Samuel 7:12-14](rc://en/tn/help/2sa/07/12)\n* [Acts 3:19](rc://en/tn/help/act/03/19)\n* [Daniel 9:24](rc://en/tn/help/dan/09/24)\n* [Genesis 4:7](rc://en/tn/help/gen/04/07)\n* [Hebrews 12:2](rc://en/tn/help/heb/12/02)\n* [Isaiah 53:11](rc://en/tn/help/isa/53/11)\n* [Jeremiah 18:23](rc://en/tn/help/jer/18/23)\n* [Leviticus 4:14](rc://en/tn/help/lev/04/14)\n* [Luke 15:18](rc://en/tn/help/luk/15/18)\n* [Matthew 12:31](rc://en/tn/help/mat/12/31)\n* [Romans 6:23](rc://en/tn/help/rom/06/23)\n* [Romans 8:4](rc://en/tn/help/rom/08/04)\n\n## Examples from the Bible stories:\n\n* __[3:15](rc://en/tn/help/obs/03/15)__ God said, “I promise I will never again curse the ground because of the evil things people do, or destroy the world by causing a flood, even though people are __sinful__ from the time they are children.”\n* __[13:12](rc://en/tn/help/obs/13/12)__ God was very angry with them because of their __sin__ and planned to destroy them.\n* __[20:1](rc://en/tn/help/obs/20/01)__ The kingdoms of Israel and Judah both __sinned__ against God.

It could also mean “human being.”\n* Throughout the Old Testament book of Ezekiel, God frequently addressed Ezekiel as “son of man.” For example he said, “You, son of man, must prophesy.”\n* The prophet Daniel saw a vision of a “son of man” coming with the clouds, which is a reference to the coming Messiah.\n* Jesus also said that the Son of Man will be coming back someday on the clouds.\n* These references to the Son of Man coming on the clouds reveal that Jesus the Messiah is God.\n\n## Translation Suggestions:\n\n* When Jesus uses the term “Son of Man” it could be translated as “the One who became a human being” or “the Man from heaven.”\n* Some translators occasionally include “I” or “me” with this title (as in “I, the Son of Man”) to make it clear that Jesus was talking about himself.\n* Check to make sure that the translation of this term does not give a wrong meaning (such as referring to an illegitimate son or giving the wrong impression that Jesus was only a human being).\n* When used to refer to a person, “son of man” could also be translated as “you, a human being” or “you, man” or “human being” or “man.”\n\n(See also: [heaven](../kt/heaven.md), [son](../kt/son.md), [Son of God](../kt/sonofgod.md), [Yahweh](../kt/yahweh.md))\n\n## Bible References:\n\n* [Acts 7:56](rc://en/tn/help/act/07/56)\n* [Daniel 7:14](rc://en/tn/help/dan/07/14)\n* [Ezekiel 43:6-8](rc://en/tn/help/ezk/43/06)\n* [John 3:12-13](rc://en/tn/help/jhn/03/12)\n* [Luke 6:5](rc://en/tn/help/luk/06/05)\n* [Mark 2:10](rc://en/tn/help/mrk/02/10)\n* [Matthew 13:37](rc://en/tn/help/mat/13/37)\n* [Psalms 80:17-18](rc://en/tn/help/psa/080/017)\n* [Revelation 14:14](rc://en/tn/help/rev/14/14)\n\n## Word Data:\n\n* Strong’s: H0120, H0606, H1121, H1247, G04440, G52070\n",

Then they were called “the twelve” again.\n\n## Translation Suggestions:\n\n* For many languages it may be clearer or more natural to add the noun and say, “the twelve apostles” or “Jesus’ twelve closest disciples.”\n* “The eleven” could also be translated as “Jesus’ eleven remaining disciples.”\n* Some translations may prefer to use a capital letter to show that it was used as a title, as in “the Twelve” and “the Eleven.”\n\n(See also: [apostle](../kt/apostle.md), [disciple](../kt/disciple.md))\n\n## Bible References:\n\n* [1 Corinthians 15:5-7](rc://en/tn/help/1co/15/05)\n* [Acts 6:2](rc://en/tn/help/act/06/02)\n* [Luke 9:1](rc://en/tn/help/luk/09/01)\n* [Luke 18:31](rc://en/tn/help/luk/18/31)\n* [Mark 10:32-34](rc://en/tn/help/mrk/10/32)\n* [Matthew 10:7](rc://en/tn/help/mat/10/07)\n\n## Word Data:\n\n* Strong’s: G14270, G17330\n",

This kind of bread is flat because it has no leaven to make it rise.\n\n* When God freed the Israelites from slavery in Egypt, he told them to flee Egypt quickly without waiting for their bread to rise. So they ate unleavened bread with their meal.

      "wrath": "# wrath, fury\n\n## Definition:\n\nWrath is an intense anger that is sometimes long-lasting. The Bible describes both people and God as experiencing intense anger. When speaking about God’s “wrath,” make sure the word or phrase used to translate this term does not refer to a sinful fit of rage (which might be true of a human person).\n\n* In the Bible, “wrath” often refers to God’s righteous judgment of sin and punishment of people who rebel against him.\n* The “wrath of God” can also refer to his judgment and punishment for sin.\n* God’s wrath is the righteous penalty for those who do not repent of their sin.\n\n## Translation Suggestions:\n\n* Depending on the context, other ways this term could be translated include “intense anger” or “righteous judgment” or “anger.”\n* God’s wrath is just and holy. When talking about God’s wrath, make sure the word or phrase used to translate this term does not refer to a sinful human rage.\n\n(See also: [judge](../kt/judge.md), [sin](../kt/sin.md))\n\n## Bible References:\n\n* [1 Thessalonians 1:8-10](rc://en/tn/help/1th/01/08)\n* [1 Timothy 2:8-10](rc://en/tn/help/1ti/02/08)\n* [Luke 3:7](rc://en/tn/help/luk/03/7)\n* [Luke 21:23](rc://en/tn/help/luk/21/23)\n* [Matthew 3:7](rc://en/tn/help/mat/03/07)\n* [Revelation 14:10](rc://en/tn/help/rev/14/10)\n* [Romans 1:18](rc://en/tn/help/rom/01/18)\n* [Romans 5:9](rc://en/tn/help/rom/05/09)\n\n## Word Data:\n\n* Strong’s: H0639, H2197, H2528, H2534, H2740, H3707, H3708, H5678, H7107, H7109, H7110, H7265, H7267, G23720, G37090, G39490, G39500\n",
      "yahweh": "# Yahweh\n\n## Facts:\n\nThe term “Yahweh” is God’s personal name in the Old Testament. The specific origin of this name is unknown, but it is probably derived from the Hebrew verb meaning, “to be.”\n\n* Following tradition, many Bible versions use the term “LORD” or “the LORD” to represent “Yahweh.” This tradition resulted from the fact that historically, the Jewish people became afraid of mispronouncing Yahweh’s name and started saying “Lord” every time the term “Yahweh” appeared in the text. Modern Bibles write “LORD” with all capital letters to show respect for God’s personal name and to distinguish it from “Lord” which is a different Hebrew word.\n* The ULT and UST texts always translate this term as, “Yahweh,” in agreement with the Hebrew text of the Old Testament.\n* The term “Yahweh” never occurs in the original text of the New Testament; only the Greek term for “Lord” is used, even when quoting the Old Testament.\n* In the Old Testament, when God spoke about himself, he would often use his name instead of a pronoun.\n* “Yah” is a shortened form of the name Yahweh that occurs in poetry and praise (e.g. Hallelujah = \"Praise Yah\"), and in some Hebrew names (e.g. Zechariah = “Yah remembers”).\n\n## Translation Suggestions:\n\n* “Yahweh” could be translated by a word or phrase that means “I am” or “existing one” or “the one who is” or “he who is present.”\n* This term could also be written in a way that is similar to how “Yahweh” is spelled.\n* Some church denominations prefer not to use the term “Yahweh” and instead use the traditional rendering, “LORD.” An important consideration is that this may be confusing when read aloud because it will sound the same as the title “Lord.” Some languages may have an affix or other grammatical marker that could be added to distinguish “LORD” as a name (Yahweh) from “Lord” as a title.\n* It is best if possible to keep the name Yahweh where it literally occurs in the text, but some translations may decide to use only a pronoun in some places, to make the text more natural and clear.\n* Introduce the quote with something like, “This is what Yahweh says.”\n\n(Translation suggestions: [How to Translate Names](rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names))\n\n(See also: [God](../kt/god.md), [Lord](../kt/lord.md))\n\n## Bible References:\n\n* [1 Kings 21:20](rc://en/tn/help/1ki/21/20)\n* [1 Samuel 16:7](rc://en/tn/help/1sa/16/07)\n* [Daniel 9:3](rc://en/tn/help/dan/09/03)\n* [Ezekiel 17:24](rc://en/tn/help/ezk/17/24)\n* [Genesis 2:4](rc://en/tn/help/gen/02/04)\n* [Genesis 4:3-5](rc://en/tn/help/gen/04/03)\n* [Genesis 28:13](rc://en/tn/help/gen/28/13)\n* [Hosea 11:12](rc://en/tn/help/hos/11/12)\n* [Isaiah 10:4](rc://en/tn/help/isa/10/04)\n* [Isaiah 38:8](rc://en/tn/help/isa/38/08)\n* [Job 12:10](rc://en/tn/help/job/12/10)\n* [Joshua 1:9](rc://en/tn/help/jos/01/09)\n* [Lamentations 1:5](rc://en/tn/help/lam/01/05)\n* [Leviticus 25:35](rc://en/tn/help/lev/25/35)\n* [Malachi 3:4](rc://en/tn/help/mal/03/04)\n* [Micah 2:5](rc://en/tn/help/mic/02/05)\n* [Micah 6:5](rc://en/tn/help/mic/06/05)\n* [Numbers 8:11](rc://en/tn/help/num/08/11)\n* [Psalm 124:3](rc://en/tn/help/psa/124/03)\n* [Ruth 1:21](rc://en/tn/help/rut/01/21)\n* [Zechariah 14:5](rc://en/tn/help/zec/14/5)\n\n## Examples from the Bible stories:\n\n* __[9:14](rc://en/tn/help/obs/09/14)__ God said, “I AM WHO I AM.

      "yahwehofhosts": "# Yahweh of hosts, God of hosts, host of heaven, host of the heavens, Lord of hosts\n\n## Definition:\n\nThe terms “Yahweh of hosts” and “God of hosts” are titles that express God’s authority over the thousands of angels who obey him.\n\n* The term “host” or “hosts” is a word that refers to a large number of something, such as an army of people or the massive number of stars. It can also refer to all the many spirit beings, including evil spirits. The context makes it clear what is being referred to.\n* Phrases similar to “host of the heavens” refer to all the stars, planets and other heavenly bodies.\n* In the New Testament, the phrase, “Lord of hosts” means the same as “Yahweh of hosts” but it cannot be translated that way since the Hebrew word “Yahweh” is not used in the New Testament.\n\n## Translation Suggestions:\n\n* Ways to translate “Yahweh of hosts” could include, “Yahweh, who rules all the angels” or “Yahweh, the ruler over armies of angels” or “Yahweh, the ruler of all creation.”\n* The phrase “of hosts” in the terms “God of hosts” and “Lord of hosts” would be translated the same way as in the phrase “Yahweh of hosts” above.\n* Certain churches do not accept the literal term “Yahweh” and prefer to use the capitalized word, “LORD” instead, following the tradition of many Bible versions. For these churches, a translation of the term “LORD of hosts” would be used in the Old Testament for “Yahweh of hosts.”\n\n(See also: [angel](../kt/angel.md), [authority](../kt/authority.md), [God](../kt/god.md), [lord](../kt/lord.md), [Lord](../kt/lord.md), [Lord Yahweh](../kt/lordyahweh.md) [Yahweh](../kt/yahweh.md))\n\n## Bible References:\n\n* [Zechariah 13:2](rc://en/tn/help/zec/13/02)\n\n## Word Data:\n\n* Strong’s: H0430, H3068, H6635, G29620, G45190\n",

Later, “Zion” and “Mount Zion” became used as general terms to refer to both of these mountains and to the city of Jerusalem. Sometimes they also referred to the temple that was located in Jerusalem.

The “Rapha” are called “Raphaites” or “Rephaim.”\n\n* There was a valley named after this people group, “the valley of the Raphaites,” which is mentioned six times in the Old Testament.\n* “Rapha” is an English transliteration of a Hebrew word. It is difficult to determine with certainty what the word “Rapha” means and consequently what type of beings the word “Rapha” refers to, whether a group of living people, spirits, or quasi-divine beings. For this reason many English translations have chosen to transliterate the original language (Hebrew) word as “Rephaites” or “Rephaim.” You may desire to do the same thing in your translation.\n* In Job 26:5, Psalm 88:10, Proverbs 2:18, Proverbs 9:18, Proverbs 21:16, Isaiah 14:9, Isaiah 26:14, and Isaiah 26:19 the term “Raphaites” refers to people who are dead or to their “spirits.” \n* In all other occurrences in the Old Testament the term “Raphaites” refers to the people group who were human beings who were alive and made up a specific people group.\n* The people group the Ammonites called the Raphaites by the name “Zamzummites” (See Deuteronomy 2:20).\n* The term “Rapha” refers to the living people group in every occurrence in the Old Testament except in 1 Chronicles 8:2 and 8:37. In each of these two verses it refers to the name of a man (a different man in each verse).\n\n(Translation suggestions: [How to Translate Names](rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names), [Copy or Borrow Words](rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-transliterate))\n\n\n## Bible References:\n\n\n## Word Data:\n\n* Strong’s: \n",

In this system there are twelve or thirteen months in a year. Despite the year being twelve or thirteen months, the first month is always called the same name even though it may be a different season.\n* The “new moon,” or beginning phase of the moon with its sliver of light, marks the beginning of each month in the lunar calendar.\n* All the names of months referred to in the Bible are those of the lunar calendar since this was the system used by the Israelites. Modern Jews still use this calendar for religious purposes.\n* The modern-day solar calendar is based on how long it takes the earth to go around the sun (about 365 days).

This is according to the lunar calendar system which is based on the time it takes for the moon to go around the earth.\n\n* A year in the modern-day solar calendar lasts 365 days divided into twelve months, based on the amount of time it takes for the earth to travel around the sun.\n* In both calendar systems a year has twelve months. But an extra thirteenth month is sometimes added to the year in the lunar calendar to make up for the fact that a lunar year is eleven days less than a solar year. This helps keep the two calendars more in line with each other.\n* In the Bible, the term “year” is also used in a figurative sense to refer to a general time when a special event takes place.

      "footstool": "# footstool\n\n## Definition:\n\nThe term “footstool” refers to an object which a person puts his feet on, usually to rest them while sitting. This term also has figurative meanings of submission and lower status.\n\n* People in Bible times considered feet to be the least honorable parts of the body. So a “footstool” was of even lower honor because feet were rested on it.\n* When God says “I will make my enemies a footstool for my feet” he is declaring power, control, and victory over the people who rebel against him.

When one goat was sacrificed, the priest would lay his hands on a second, live goat, and send it into the desert as a symbol that the animal was bearing the people’s sins.\n\n(See also: [flock](../other/flock.md), [sacrifice](../other/sacrifice.md), [sheep](../other/sheep.md), [righteous](../kt/righteous.md), [wine](../other/wine.md))\n\n## Bible References:\n\n* [Exodus 12:3-4](rc://en/tn/help/exo/12/03)\n* [Genesis 30:32](rc://en/tn/help/gen/30/32)\n* [Genesis 31:10](rc://en/tn/help/gen/31/10)\n* [Genesis 37:31](rc://en/tn/help/gen/37/31)\n* [Leviticus 3:12-14](rc://en/tn/help/lev/03/12)\n* [Matthew 25:33](rc://en/tn/help/mat/25/33)\n\n## Word Data:\n\n* Strong’s: H0689, H1423, H1429, H3277, H3629, H5795, H5796, H6260, H6629, H6842, H7716, H8163, H8166, H8495, G01220, G20550, G20560, G51310\n",

The lamps were filled with olive oil that soaked the wick and burned when the wick was lighted.\n* In the Jerusalem temple there was a special gold lampstand that had seven branches for holding seven lamps.\n\n## Translation Suggestions\n\n* This term could be also translated as “lamp pedestal” or “structure for holding a lamp” or “lamp holder.”\n* For the temple lampstand, this could be translated as “seven-lamp lampstand” or “gold pedestal with seven lamps.”\n* It would also be helpful in a translation to include pictures of a simple lampstand and a seven-branch lampstand in the relevant Bible passages.\n\n(See also: [bronze](../other/bronze.md), [gold](../other/gold.md), [lamp](../other/lamp.md), [light](../other/light.md), [silver](../other/silver.md), [temple](../kt/temple.md))\n\n## Bible References:\n\n* [Daniel 5:5-6](rc://en/tn/help/dan/05/05)\n* [Exodus 37:17](rc://en/tn/help/exo/37/17)\n* [Mark 4:21-23](rc://en/tn/help/mrk/04/21)\n* [Matthew 5:15-16](rc://en/tn/help/mat/05/15)\n* [Revelation 1:12-13](rc://en/tn/help/rev/01/12)\n* [Revelation 1:20](rc://en/tn/help/rev/01/20)\n\n## Word Data:\n\n* Strong’s: H4501, G30870\n",
      "law": "# law, principle\n\n## Definition:\n\nA “law” is a legal rule that is usually written down and enforced by someone in authority. A “principle” is a guideline for decision-making and behavior, and is usually not written down or enforced. However, sometimes the term “law” is used to mean a “principle.”\n\n* A “law” is similar to a “decree,” but the term “law” is generally used to refer to something written rather than spoken.\n* Both “law” and “principle” can refer to a general rule or belief that guides a person’s behavior.\n* This meaning of “law” is different from its meaning in the term “law of Moses,” where it refers to commands and instructions that God gave the Israelites.\n* When a general law is being referred to, “law” could be translated as “principle” or “general rule.”\n\n(See also: [law of Moses](../kt/lawofmoses.md), [decree](../other/decree.md), [command](../kt/command.md), [declare](../other/declare.md))\n\n## Bible References:\n\n* [Deuteronomy 4:2](rc://en/tn/help/deu/04/02)\n* [Esther 3:8-9](rc://en/tn/help/est/03/08)\n* [Exodus 12:12-14](rc://en/tn/help/exo/12/12)\n* [Genesis 26:5](rc://en/tn/help/gen/26/05)\n* [John 18:31](rc://en/tn/help/jhn/18/31)\n* [Romans 7:1](rc://en/tn/help/rom/07/1)\n\n## Word Data:\n\n* Strong’s: H1285, H1881, H1882, H2706, H2708, H2710, H4687, H4941, H6310, H7560, H8451, G17850, G35480, G35510, G47470\n",
      "lawful": "# lawful, unlawful, not lawful, lawless, lawlessness\n\n## Definition:\n\nThe term “lawful” refers to something that is permitted to be done according to a law or other requirement. The opposite of this is “unlawful,” which simply means “not lawful.”\n\n* In the Bible, something was “lawful” if it was permitted by God’s moral law, or by the Law of Moses and other Jewish laws. Something that was “unlawful” was “not permitted” by those laws.\n* To do something “lawfully” means to do it “properly” or “in the right way.”\n* Many of the things that the Jewish laws considered lawful or not lawful were not in agreement with God’s laws about loving others.\n* Depending on the context, ways to translate “lawful” could include “permitted” or “according to God’s law” or “following our laws” or “proper” or “fitting.”\n* The phrase “Is it lawful?” could also be translated as “Do our laws allow?” or “Is that something our laws permit?”\n\nThe terms “unlawful” and “not lawful” are used to describe actions that break a law.\n\n* In the New Testament, the term “unlawful” is not only used to refer to breaking God’s laws, but also often refers to breaking Jewish man-made laws.\n* Over the years, the Jews added to the laws that God gave to them. The Jewish leaders would call something “unlawful” if it did not conform to their man-made laws.\n* When Jesus and his disciples were picking grain on a Sabbath day, the Pharisees accused them of doing something “unlawful” because it was breaking the Jewish laws about not working on that day.\n* When Peter stated that eating unclean foods was “unlawful” for him, he meant that if he ate those foods he would be breaking the laws God had given the Israelites about not eating certain foods.\n\nThe term “lawless” describes a person who does not obey laws or rules. When a country or group of people are in a state of “lawlessness,” there is widespread disobedience, rebellion, or immorality.\n\n* A lawless person is rebellious and does not obey God’s laws.\n* The apostle Paul wrote that in the last days there will be a “man of lawlessness,” or a “lawless one,” who will be influenced by Satan to do evil things.\n\n## Translation Suggestions:\n\n* This term “unlawful” should be translated using a word or expression that means “not lawful” or “lawbreaking.”\n* Other ways to translate “unlawful” could be “not permitted” or “not according to God’s law” or “not conforming to our laws.”\n* The expression “against the law” has the same meaning as “unlawful.”\n\n* The term “lawless” could also be translated as “rebellious” or “disobedient” or “law-defying”.\n* The term “lawlessness” could be translated as “not obeying any laws” or “rebellion (against God’s laws).”\n* The phrase “man of lawlessness” could be translated as “man who does not obey any laws” or “man who rebels against God’s laws.”\n* It is important to keep the concept of “law” in this term, if possible.\n* Note that the term “unlawful” has a different meaning from this term.\n\n(See also: [law](../other/law.md), [law](../kt/lawofmoses.md), [Moses](../names/moses.md), [Sabbath](../kt/sabbath.md))\n\n## Bible References:\n\n* [Matthew 7:21-23](rc://en/tn/help/mat/07/21)\n* [Matthew 12:2](rc://en/tn/help/mat/12/02)\n* [Matthew 12:4](rc://en/tn/help/mat/12/04)\n* [Matthew 12:10](rc://en/tn/help/mat/12/10)\n* [Mark 3:4](rc://en/tn/help/mrk/03/04)\n* [Luke 6:2](rc://en/tn/help/luk/06/02)\n* [Acts 2:23](rc://en/tn/help/act/02/23)\n* [Acts 10:28](rc://en/tn/help/act/10/28)\n* [Acts 22:25](rc://en/tn/help/act/22/25)\n* [2 Thessalonians 2:3](rc://en/tn/help/2th/02/03)\n* [Titus 2:14](rc://en/tn/help/tit/02/14)\n* [1 John 3:4-6](rc://en/tn/help/1jn/03/04)\n\n## Word Data:\n\n* Strong’s: H6530, G01110, G01130, G02660, G04580, G04590, G18320, G35450\n",

This could be translated as “the founders of two nations” or the “ancestors of two people groups.”\n* The word translated as “nation” was also sometimes used to refer to “Gentiles” or to people who do not worship Yahweh. The context usually makes the meaning clear.\n\n## Translation Suggestions:\n\n* Depending on the context, the word “nation” could also be translated as “people group” or “people” or “country.”\n* If a language has a term for “nation” that is distinct from these other terms, then that term can be used wherever it occurs in the Bible text, as long as it is natural and accurate in each context.\n* The plural term “nations” can often be translated as “people groups.”\n* In certain contexts, this term could also be translated as “Gentiles” or “nonJews.”\n\n(See also: [Assyria](../names/assyria.md), [Babylon](../names/babylon.md), [Canaan](../names/canaan.md), [Gentile](../kt/gentile.md), [Greek](../names/greek.md), [people group](../other/peoplegroup.md), [Philistines](../names/philistines.md), [Rome](../names/rome.md))\n\n## Bible References:\n\n* [1 Chronicles 14:15-17](rc://en/tn/help/1ch/14/15)\n* [2 Chronicles 15:6](rc://en/tn/help/2ch/15/06)\n* [2 Kings 17:11-12](rc://en/tn/help/2ki/17/11)\n* [Acts 2:5](rc://en/tn/help/act/02/05)\n* [Acts 13:19](rc://en/tn/help/act/13/19)\n* [Acts 17:26](rc://en/tn/help/act/17/26)\n* [Acts 26:4](rc://en/tn/help/act/26/04)\n* [Daniel 3:4](rc://en/tn/help/dan/03/04)\n* [Genesis 10:2-5](rc://en/tn/help/gen/10/02)\n* [Genesis 27:29](rc://en/tn/help/gen/27/29)\n* [Genesis 35:11](rc://en/tn/help/gen/35/11)\n* [Genesis 49:10](rc://en/tn/help/gen/49/10)\n* [Luke 7:5](rc://en/tn/help/luk/07/05)\n* [Mark 13:7-8](rc://en/tn/help/mrk/13/07)\n* [Matthew 21:43](rc://en/tn/help/mat/21/43)\n* [Romans 4:16-17](rc://en/tn/help/rom/04/16)\n\n## Word Data:\n\n* Strong’s: H0523, H0524, H0776, H1471, H3816, H4940, H5971, G02460, G10740, G10850, G14840\n",

In the Bible, the term “swear” means to make an oath. A “vow” is a solemn promise or oath that a person makes to God.\n\n* In a court of law, a witness often gives an oath to promise that whatever he says will be true and factual.\n* In modern times, one meaning of the word “swear” is to use foul or vulgar language.

The ancient Israelites believed that God might punish a person who did not fulfill a vow that he made.\n* In ancient Israel, sometimes a person would ask God to protect him or provide for him in exchange for making the vow. However, the ancient Israelites did not believe that God was obligated to fulfill these requests.\n\n## Translation Suggestions:\n\n* Depending on the context, “an oath” could also be translated as “a pledge” or “a solemn promise.”\n* To “swear” could be translated as to “formally promise” or to “pledge” or to “commit to do something.”\n* Other ways to translate “swear by my name” could include “make a promise using my name to confirm it.”\n* To “swear by heaven and earth” could be translated as to, “promise to do something, stating that heaven and earth will confirm it.”\n* Make sure the translation of “swear” or “oath” does not refer to cursing. In the Bible it does not have that meaning.\n* Depending on the context, the term “vow” can be translated as “solemn promise” or “solemn oath” or “promise made to God.”\n\n(See also: [Abimelech](../names/abimelech.md), [covenant](../kt/covenant.md), [promise](../kt/promise.md))\n\n## Bible References:\n\n* [Genesis 21:23](rc://en/tn/help/gen/21/23)\n* [Genesis 24:3](rc://en/tn/help/gen/24/03)\n* [Genesis 31:51-53](rc://en/tn/help/gen/31/51)\n* [Genesis 47:31](rc://en/tn/help/gen/47/31)\n* [Luke 1:73](rc://en/tn/help/luk/01/73)\n* [Mark 6:26](rc://en/tn/help/mrk/06/26)\n* [Matthew 5:36](rc://en/tn/help/mat/05/36)\n* [Matthew 14:6-7](rc://en/tn/help/mat/14/06)\n* [Matthew 26:72](rc://en/tn/help/mat/26/72)\n* [1 Corinthians 7:27-28](rc://en/tn/help/1co/07/27)\n* [Acts 21:23](rc://en/tn/help/act/21/23)\n* [Genesis 28:21](rc://en/tn/help/gen/28/21)\n* [Genesis 31:12-13](rc://en/tn/help/gen/31/12)\n* [Jonah 1:14-16](rc://en/tn/help/jon/01/14)\n* [Jonah 2:9-10](rc://en/tn/help/jon/02/09)\n* [Proverbs 7:14](rc://en/tn/help/pro/07/14)\n\n\n## Word Data:\n\n* Strong’s: H0422, H0423, H3027, H5375, H7621, H7650, G03320, G36600, G37270, G37280,  H5087, H5088, G21710\n",

When the wax cooled and hardened, the letter could not be opened without breaking the wax seal.

However, in the Bible the term “seed” is used figuratively to mean several different things.\n\n* The term “seed” is used figuratively and euphemistically to refer to the tiny cells inside a man that combine with cells of a woman to cause a baby to grow inside her. A collection of these cells is called “semen.”\n* Related to this, “seed” is also used to refer to a person’s offspring or descendants.\n* This word often has a plural meaning, referring to more than one seed grain or more than one descendant.\n* In the parable of the farmer planting seeds, Jesus compared his seeds to the Word of God, which is planted in people’s hearts in order to produce good spiritual fruit.\n* The apostle Paul also uses the term “seed” to refer to the Word of God.\n\n## Translation Suggestions:\n\n* For a literal seed, it is best to use the literal term for “seed” that is used in the target language for what a farmer plants in his field.\n* The literal term should also be used in contexts where it refers figuratively to God’s Word.\n* For the figurative use that refers to people who are of the same family line, it may be more clear to use the word “descendant” or “descendants” instead of “seed.” Some languages may have a word that means “children and grandchildren.”\n* For a man or woman’s “seed,” consider how the target expresses this in a way that will not offend or embarrass people.

      "servant": "# servant, serve, maidservant, young man, young women\n\n## Definition:\n\nA “servant” refers to a person who works for (or obeys) another person, either by choice or by force. A servant was under his master's direction. In the Bible, “servant” and “slave” are mostly interchangable terms.\nThe term “serve” generally means to do work for someone, and the concept can be applied in a wide variety of contexts.\n\n* In the Bible the words “young man” or “young woman” often mean “servant” or “slave.” This meaning will be discerned from context. One indicator of this situation is if the possessive is used, eg. “her young women” which could be translated as “her servants” or “her slaves.”\n\n## Translation Suggestions\n\n* The term “serve” can also be translated as “minister to” or “work for” or “take care of” or “obey,” depending on the context.\n* To “serve God” can be translated as to “worship and obey God” or to “do the work that God has commanded.”\n* In the Old Testament, God’s prophets and other people who worshiped God were often called his “servants.”\n* In the New Testament, people who obeyed God through faith in Christ were often called his “servants.”\n* To “serve tables” means to bring food to people who are sitting at tables, or more generally, to “distribute food.”\n* In the context of a person serving guests, this term means “care for” or “serve food to” or “provide food for.” When Jesus told the disciples to “serve” the fish to the people, this could be translated as, “distribute” or “hand out” or “give.”\n* People who teach others about God are said to serve both God and the ones they are teaching.\n* The apostle Paul wrote to the Corinthian Christians about how they used to “serve” the old covenant. This refers to obeying the laws of Moses. Now they “serve” the new covenant. That is, because of Jesus’ sacrifice on the cross, believers in Jesus are enabled by the Holy Spirit to please God and live holy lives.\n* Paul talks about their actions in terms of their “service” to either the old or new covenant. This could be translated as “serving” or “obeying” or “devotion to.”\n* Often, when a person referred to himself as “your servant” he was showing respect to the person addressed. That person may have had higher social status, or the speaker may be showing humility. It did not mean that the person speaking was an actual servant.\n\n(See also: [enslave](../other/enslave.md), [works](../kt/works.md), [obey](../other/obey.md), [house](../other/house.md), [lord](../kt/lord.md))\n\n## Bible References:\n\n\n\n## Examples from the Bible stories:\n\n* __[6:1](rc://en/tn/help/obs/06/01)__ When Abraham was very old and his son, Isaac, had grown to be a man, Abraham sent one of his __servants__ back to the land where his relatives lived to find a wife for his son, Isaac.\n* __[19:10](rc://en/tn/help/obs/19/10)__ Then Elijah prayed, “O Yahweh, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, show us today that you are the God of Israel and that I am your __servant__.”\n* __[29:3](rc://en/tn/help/obs/29/03)__ “Since the __servant__ could not pay the debt, the king said, ‘Sell this man and his family as __slaves__ to make payment on his debt.’”\n* __[35:6](rc://en/tn/help/obs/35/06)__ “All my father’s __servants__ have plenty to eat, and yet here I am starving.”\n* __[47:4](rc://en/tn/help/obs/47/04)__ The __slave__ girl kept yelling as they walked, “These men are servants of the Most High God.”\n* __[50:4](rc://en/tn/help/obs/50/04)__ Jesus also said, “A __servant__ is not greater than his master.”\n\n## Word Data:\n\n* (Servant) Strong’s: H0519, H5288, H5647, H5649, H5650, H5657, H7916, H8198, H8334, G12490, G14010, G14020, G23240, G34070, G34110, G36100, G38160, G49830, G52570\n* (Serve) H3547, H4929, H4931, H5647, H5656, H5673, H5975, H6213, H6399, H6402, H6440, H6633, H6635, H7272, H8104, H8120, H8199, H8278, H8334, G12470, G12480, G13980, G14020, G14380, G19830, G20640, G22120, G23230, G29990, G30000, G30090, G43370, G43420, G47540, G50870, G52560\n",

The act of shaming someone is called “humiliation.”\n* To “reproach” someone means to criticize or disapprove of that person’s character or behavior.\n* The phrase “put to shame” means to defeat people or expose their actions so that they feel ashamed of themselves. The prophet Isaiah said that those who make and worship idols will be put to shame.\n* The term “disgraceful” can be used to describe a sinful act or the person who did it. When a person does something sinful, it can cause him to be in a state of disgrace or dishonor.\n* Sometimes a person who is doing good things is treated in a way that causes him disgrace or shame. For example, when Jesus was killed on a cross, this was a disgraceful way to die. Jesus had done nothing wrong to deserve this disgrace.\n* When God humbles someone, it means that he is causing a prideful person to experience failure to help him overcome his pride. This is different from humiliating someone, which is often done in order to hurt that person.\n* Saying that a person is “above reproach” or “beyond reproach” or “without reproach” means that this person behaves in a God-honoring way and there is little or nothing that could be said in criticism of him.\n\n## Translation Suggestions\n\n* Ways to translate “disgrace” could include “shame” or “dishonor.”\n* Ways to translate “disgraceful” could include “shameful” or “dishonoring.”\n* To “humiliate” could also be translated as to “shame” or to “cause to feel shame” or to “embarrass.”\n* Depending on the context, ways to translate “humiliation” could include “shame” or “degrading” or “disgrace.”\n* The word “reproach” could also be translated as “accusation” or “shame” or “disgrace.”\n* To “reproach” could also be translated as to “rebuke” or to “accuse” or to “criticize,” depending on the context.\n\n(See also: [dishonor](../other/dishonor.md), [accuse](../other/accuse.md), [rebuke](../other/rebuke.md), [false god](../kt/falsegod.md), [humble](../kt/humble.md), [Isaiah](../names/isaiah.md), [worship](../kt/worship.md))\n\n## Bible References:\n\n* [1 Peter 3:15-17](rc://en/tn/help/1pe/03/15)\n* [2 Kings 2:17](rc://en/tn/help/2ki/02/17)\n* [2 Samuel 13:13](rc://en/tn/help/2sa/13/13)\n* [Luke 20:11](rc://en/tn/help/luk/20/11)\n* [Mark 8:38](rc://en/tn/help/mrk/08/38)\n* [Mark 12:4-5](rc://en/tn/help/mrk/12/04)\n* [1 Timothy 3:7](rc://en/tn/help/1ti/03/07)\n* [Genesis 34:7](rc://en/tn/help/gen/34/07)\n* [Hebrews 11:26](rc://en/tn/help/heb/11/26)\n* [Lamentations 2:1-2](rc://en/tn/help/lam/02/01)\n* [Psalms 22:6](rc://en/tn/help/psa/022/06)\n* [Deuteronomy 21:14](rc://en/tn/help/deu/21/14)\n* [Ezra 9:5](rc://en/tn/help/ezr/09/05)\n* [Proverbs 25:7-8](rc://en/tn/help/pro/25/07)\n* [Psalms 6:8-10](rc://en/tn/help/psa/006/008)\n* [Psalms 123:3](rc://en/tn/help/psa/123/03)\n* [1 Timothy 5:7-8](rc://en/tn/help/1ti/05/07)\n* [1 Timothy 6:13-14](rc://en/tn/help/1ti/06/13)\n* [Jeremiah 15:15-16](rc://en/tn/help/jer/15/15)\n* [Job 16:9-10](rc://en/tn/help/job/16/09)\n* [Proverbs 18:3](rc://en/tn/help/pro/18/03)\n\n## Word Data:\n\n* Strong’s: H0937, H0954, H0955, H1317, H1322, H1421, H1442, H1984, H2490, H2616, H2617, H2659, H2778, H2781, H2865, H3001, H3637, H3639, H3640, H3971, H5007, H5034, H5039, H6030, H6031, H6172, H6256, H7022, H7034, H7036, H7043, H7511, H7817, H8103, H8213, H8216, H8217, H8589, G01520, G01530, G04100, G04220, G04230, G08080, G08180, G08190, G08210, G17880, G17910, G18700, G26170, G30590, G36790, G36800, G36810, G38560, G50140, G51950, G51960, G54840\n",

A “sower” is a person who sows or plants seeds. A “plant” is generally something that grows and is attached to the ground.\n\n* One method of sowing or planting seeds during biblical times was to take handfuls of seeds and scatter them on the ground.\n* Farmers would often plow the ground on which they had sown seeds after they had sown the seeds. The reason farmers would plow the ground after they had sown the seed is so that the seed would be covered with soil. \n* Sometimes farmers may have plowed the field that they sowed seeds in both before and after sowing seeds.\n\n## Translations Suggestions\n\n* The term to “sow” could also be translated as to “plant.” Make sure the word or phrase you use to translate this term refers to, or can include, planting seeds by scattering them because this is the method of sowing that Jesus was referring to in his parable in Matthew 13:3-23, Mark 4:2-20, and Luke 8:4-8 where he describes a sower who sowed seeds.\n* Other ways to translate “sower” could include “planter” or “farmer” or “person who plants seeds.”\n* In English, “sow” is only used for planting seeds, but the English word “plant” can be used for planting seeds as well as larger things, such as trees.

With his sword, Peter cut off the ear of the high priest’s servant.\n* Both John the Baptist and the apostle James were beheaded with swords.\n\n## Translation Suggestions\n\n* A sword is used as a metaphor for God’s word. God’s teachings in the Bible exposed people’s innermost thoughts and convicted them of their sin. In a similar way, a sword cuts deeply, causing pain. (See: [Metaphor](rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor))\n* One way to translate this figurative use would be, “God’s word is like a sword, which cuts deeply and exposes sin.”\n* Another figurative use of this term occurred in the book of Psalms, where the tongue or speech of a person was compared to a sword, which can injure people. This could be translated as “the tongue is like a sword that can badly injure someone.”\n* If swords are not known in your culture, this word could be translated with the name of another long-bladed weapon that is used to cut or stab.\n* A sword could also be described as a “sharp weapon” or “long knife.” Some translations could include a picture of a sword.\n\n(See also: [How to Translate Unknowns](rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown))\n\n(See also: [James (brother of Jesus)](../names/jamesbrotherofjesus.md), [John (the Baptist)](../names/johnthebaptist.md), [tongue](../other/tongue.md), [word of God](../kt/wordofgod.md))\n\n## Bible References:\n\n* [Acts 12:2](rc://en/tn/help/act/12/02)\n* [Genesis 27:40](rc://en/tn/help/gen/27/40)\n* [Genesis 34:25](rc://en/tn/help/gen/34/25)\n* [Luke 2:33-35](rc://en/tn/help/luk/02/33)\n* [Luke 21:24](rc://en/tn/help/luk/21/24)\n* [Matthew 10:34](rc://en/tn/help/mat/10/34)\n* [Matthew 26:55](rc://en/tn/help/mat/26/55)\n* [Revelation 1:16](rc://en/tn/help/rev/01/16)\n\n## Word Data:\n\n* Strong’s: H0019, H1300, H2719, H4380, H6609, H7524, H7973, G31620, G45010\n",

The tax collectors would keep the extra amount for themselves.\n* Because tax collectors cheated people in this way, the Jews considered them to be among the worst of sinners.\n* The Jews also considered Jewish tax collectors to be traitors to their own people because they worked for the Roman government which was oppressing the Jewish people.\n* The phrase, “tax collectors and sinners” was a common expression in the New Testament, showing how much the Jews despised tax collectors.\n\n(See also: [Jew](../kt/jew.md), [Rome](../names/rome.md), [sin](../kt/sin.md))\n\n## Bible References:\n\n* [Luke 20:21-22](rc://en/tn/help/luk/20/21)\n* [Mark 2:13-14](rc://en/tn/help/mrk/02/13)\n* [Matthew 9:7-9](rc://en/tn/help/mat/09/07)\n* [Numbers 31:28-29](rc://en/tn/help/num/31/28)\n* [Romans 13:6-7](rc://en/tn/help/rom/13/06)\n* [Luke 3:12-13](rc://en/tn/help/luk/03/12)\n* [Luke 5:27-28](rc://en/tn/help/luk/05/27)\n* [Matthew 5:46-48](rc://en/tn/help/mat/05/46)\n* [Matthew 9:10-11](rc://en/tn/help/mat/09/10)\n* [Matthew 11:18-19](rc://en/tn/help/mat/11/18)\n* [Matthew 17:26-27](rc://en/tn/help/mat/17/26)\n* [Matthew 18:17](rc://en/tn/help/mat/18/17)\n\n## Examples from the Bible stories:\n\n34:6 He said, “Two men went to the Temple to pray. One of them was a tax collector, and the other was a religious leader.”\n34:7 “The religious leader prayed like this, ‘Thank you, God, that I am not a sinner like other men—such as robbers, unjust men, adulterers, or even like that tax collector.’”\n34:9 “But the tax collector stood far away from the religious ruler, did not even look up to heaven. Instead, he pounded on his chest and prayed, ‘God, please be merciful to me because I am a sinner.’”\n34:10 Then Jesus said, “I tell you the truth, God heard the tax collector’s prayer and declared him to be righteous.”\n35:1 One day, Jesus was teaching many tax collectors and other sinners who had gathered to hear him.\n\n## Word Data:\n\n* Tax: Strong’s: H2670, H4060, H4371, H4522, H4864, H6186, G13230, G27780, G50550, G54110\n* Tax Collector: Strong’s: H5065, H5674, G50570, G50580\n",

The robbers had beaten the Jewish man and wounded him before stealing his money and clothing.\n* Both thieves and robbers come suddenly to steal, when people are not expecting it. Often they use the cover of darkness to hide what they are doing.\n* In a figurative sense, the New Testament describes Satan as a thief who comes to steal, kill, and destroy. This means that Satan’s plan is to try to get God’s people to stop obeying him. If he succeeded in doing this Satan would be stealing from them the good things that God has planned for them.\n* Jesus compared the suddenness of his return to the suddenness of a thief coming to steal from people.

A “broken cistern” happened when the plaster became cracked so that the water leaked out.\n* Cisterns were often located in the courtyard area of people’s homes to catch the rainwater that would run off the roof.\n* Wells were often located where they could be accessed by several families or a whole community.\n* Because water was very important for both people and livestock, the right to use a well was often a cause of strife and conflict.\n* Both wells and cisterns were usually covered with a large stone to prevent anything falling in it. Often there was a rope with a bucket or pot attached to it to bring the water up to the surface.\n* Sometimes a dry cistern was used as a place to imprison someone, such as happened to Joseph and Jeremiah.\n\n## Translation Suggestions:\n\n* Ways to translate “well” could include “deep water hole” or “deep hole for spring water” or “deep hole for drawing water.”\n* The term “cistern” could be translated as “stone water pit” or “deep and narrow pit for water” or “underground tank for holding water.”\n* These terms are similar in meaning.

Wine was stored in “wineskins,” which were containers made out of animal skin.\n\n* The term “new wine” referred to grape juice that had just been taken from the grape and was not fermented yet. Sometimes the term “wine” also referred to unfermented grape juice.\n* To make wine, grapes are crushed in a winepress so that the juice comes out. The juice eventually ferments and alcohol forms in it.\n* In Bible times, wine was the normal drink with meals. It did not have as much alcohol as present-day wine has.\n* Before wine was served for a meal, it was often mixed with water.\n* A wineskin that was old and brittle would get cracks in it, which allowed the wine to leak out. New wineskins were soft and flexible, which meant they did not tear easily and could store the wine safely.\n* If wine is unknown in your culture, it could be translated as “fermented grape juice” or “fermented drink made from a fruit called grapes” or “fermented fruit juice.” (See: [How to Translate Unknowns](rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown))\n* Ways to translate “wineskin” could include “bag for wine” or “animal skin wine bag” or “animal skin container for wine.”\n\n(See also: [grape](../other/grape.md), [vine](../other/vine.md), [vineyard](../other/vineyard.md), [winepress](../other/winepress.md))\n\n## Bible References:\n\n* [1 Timothy 5:23](rc://en/tn/help/1ti/05/23)\n* [Genesis 9:21](rc://en/tn/help/gen/09/21)\n* [Genesis 49:12](rc://en/tn/help/gen/49/12)\n* [John 2:3-5](rc://en/tn/help/jhn/02/03)\n* [John 2:10](rc://en/tn/help/jhn/02/10)\n* [Matthew 9:17](rc://en/tn/help/mat/09/17)\n* [Matthew 11:18](rc://en/tn/help/mat/11/18)\n\nsmashed\n\n## Word Data:\n\n* Strong’s: H2561, H2562, H3196, H4469, H4997, H5435, H6025, H6071, H8492, G10980, G36310, G38200, G39430\n",
      "winepress": "# winepress\n\n## Definition:\n\nDuring Bible times, a “winepress” was a large container or open place where the juice of grapes was extracted in order to make wine.\n\n* In Israel, winepresses were usually large, wide basins that were dug out of solid rock. Clusters of grapes were put on the flat bottom of the hole and people trampled the grapes with their feet to get the grape juice to flow out.\n* Usually a winepress had two levels, with the grapes being trampled in the top level so that the juice would run down into the lower level where it could be collected.\n* The term “winepress” is also used figuratively in the Bible as a picture of God’s wrath being poured out on wicked people.

In the Bible, both words can also be used to refer to separating or dividing people.\n\n* To “winnow” means to separate grain from the unwanted parts of the plant by tossing both the grain and chaff into the air, allowing the wind to blow the chaff away.\n* The word “sift” refers to shaking the winnowed grain in a sieve to get rid of any remaining unwanted materials, such as dirt or stones.\n* In the Old Testament, “winnow” and “sift” are used figuratively to describe hardship that separates the righteous people from the unrighteous people.\n* Jesus also used the term “sift” in this figurative way when he was telling Simon Peter about how he and the other disciples would be tested in their faith.\n* To translate these terms, use the words or phrases in the project language that refer to these activities; possible translations might be “shaking” or “fanning.” If winnowing or sifting are not known, then these terms could be translated by a term that refers to a different method of separating grain from chaff or dirt, or by describing this process.\n\n(See also: [How to Translate Unknowns](rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown))\n\n(See also: [chaff](../other/chaff.md), [grain](../other/grain.md))\n\n## Bible References:\n\n* [Isaiah 21:10](rc://en/tn/help/isa/21/10)\n* [Luke 22:31](rc://en/tn/help/luk/22/31)\n* [Matthew 3:12](rc://en/tn/help/mat/03/12)\n* [Proverbs 20:8](rc://en/tn/help/pro/20/08)\n* [Ruth 3:2](rc://en/tn/help/rut/03/02)\n\n## Word Data:\n\n* Strong’s: H2219, H5128, H5130, G44250, G46170\n",
      "wisemen": "# wise men, advisor\n\n## Definition:\n\nThe term “wise men” simply means people who are wise. In the Bible, however, the term “wise men” often refers to men with unusual knowledge and abilities who served in a king’s royal court as advisors to the king or other high officials.\n\n### Old Testament\n\n* Sometimes the term “wise men” is explained in the text as “prudent men” or “men with understanding.” This refers to men who act wisely and righteously because they obey God.\n* The “wise men” who served pharaohs or other kings were often scholars who studied the stars, especially looking for special meanings for the patterns that the stars made in their positions in the sky. Sometimes “wise men” also practiced divination of performed acts of magic, probably by the power of evil spirits.\n* Often wise men were expected to explain the meanings of dreams. For example, King Nebuchadnezzar demanded that his wise men describe his dreams and tell him what they meant, but none of them was able to do this, except Daniel who had received this knowledge from God.\n\n### New Testament\n\n* The group of men who came from eastern regions to worship Jesus were called “magi,” which is often translated as “wise men,” since this probably refers to scholars who served a ruler of an eastern country.\n\n## Translation Suggestions:\n\n* Depending on the context, the term “wise men” could be translated using the term “wise” or with a phrase such as “gifted men” or “educated men” or some other term that refers to men who have an important job working for a ruler.\n* When the term “wise men” simply means people who are wise, the word “wise” should be translated in the same or similar way to how it is translated elsewhere in the Bible.\n\n(See also: [Babylon](../names/babylon.md), [Daniel](../names/daniel.md), [divination](../other/divination.md), [magic](../other/magic.md), [Nebuchadnezzar](../names/nebuchadnezzar.md), [ruler](../other/ruler.md), [wise](../kt/wise.md))\n\n## Bible References:\n\n* [1 Chronicles 27:32-34](rc://en/tn/help/1ch/27/32)\n* [Daniel 2:1-2](rc://en/tn/help/dan/02/01)\n* [Daniel 2:10-11](rc://en/tn/help/dan/02/10)\n\n## Word Data:\n\n* Strong’s: H2445, H2450, H3778, H3779, G46800\n",

False teaching causes people to believe wrong things that bring harm to them.\n* This comparison is based on the fact that sheep are especially vulnerable to being attacked and eaten by wolves, because they are weak and cannot defend themselves.\n\n## Translation Suggestion\n\n* This term could be translated as “wild dog” or “wild animal.”\n* Other names for wild dogs could be “jackal” or “coyote.”\n* When used figuratively to refer to people, this could be translated as “evil people who harm people like animals that attack sheep.”\n\n(See also: [evil](../kt/evil.md), [false prophet](../other/falseprophet.md), [sheep](../other/sheep.md), [teach](../other/teach.md))\n\n## Bible References:\n\n* [Acts 20:29](rc://en/tn/help/act/20/29)\n* [Isaiah 11:7](rc://en/tn/help/isa/11/07)\n* [John 10:11-13](rc://en/tn/help/jhn/10/11)\n* [Luke 10:3](rc://en/tn/help/luk/10/03)\n* [Matthew 7:15](rc://en/tn/help/mat/07/15)\n* [Zephaniah 3:3](rc://en/tn/help/zep/03/03)\n\n## Word Data:\n\n* Strong’s: H2061, H3611, G30740\n",

      "yeast": "# yeast, leaven, unleavened\n\n## Definition:\n\n“Leaven” is a general term for a substance that causes bread dough to expand and rise. “Yeast” is a specific kind of leaven.\n\n* In some English translations, the word for leaven is translated as “yeast,” which is a modern leavening agent that fills the bread dough with gas bubbles, making the dough expand before baking it. The yeast is kneaded into the dough so that it spreads throughout the entire lump of dough.\n* In Old Testament times, the leavening or rising agent was produced by allowing the dough to sit for awhile. Small amounts of dough from a previous batch of dough were saved as leavening for the next batch.\n* When the Israelites escaped from Egypt, they didn’t have time to wait for bread dough to rise, so they made bread without leaven to take with them on their journey. As a reminder of this, every year the Jewish people celebrate Passover by eating bread that has no leaven in it.\n* The term “leaven” or “yeast” is used figuratively in the Bible as a picture of how sin spreads through a person’s life or how sin can influence other people.\n* It can also refer to false teaching which often spreads to many people and influences them.\n* The term “leaven” is also used in a positive way to explain how the influence of God’s kingdom spreads from person to person.\n\n## Translation Suggestions\n\n* This could be translated as “leaven” or “substance that causes dough to rise” or “expanding agent.” The word “rise” could be expressed as “expand” or “get bigger” or “puff up.”\n* If a local leavening agent is used for making bread dough rise, that term can be used. If the language has a well-known, general term that means “leavening,” this would be the best term to use.\n\n(See also: [Egypt](../names/egypt.md), [Passover](../kt/passover.md), [unleavened bread](../kt/unleavenedbread.md))\n\n## Bible References:\n\n\n* [Exodus 12:8](rc://en/tn/help/exo/12/08)\n* [Galatians 5:9-10](rc://en/tn/help/gal/05/09)\n* [Luke 12:1](rc://en/tn/help/luk/12/1)\n* [Luke 13:21](rc://en/tn/help/luk/13/21)\n* [Matthew 13:33](rc://en/tn/help/mat/13/33)\n* [Matthew 16:8](rc://en/tn/help/mat/16/08)\n\n## Word Data:\n\n* Strong’s: H2556, H2557, H4682, H7603, G01060, G22190, G22200\n",
      "yoke": "# yoke, yoked, tied\n\n## Definition:\n\nA yoke is a piece of wood or metal attached to two or more animals to connect them for the purpose of pulling a plow or a cart. There are also several figurative meanings for this term.\n\n* The term “yoke” is used figuratively to refer to something that joins people for the purpose of working together, such as in serving Jesus.\n* Paul used the term “yokefellow” to refer to someone who was serving Christ as he was. This could also be translated as “fellow worker” or “fellow servant” or “coworker.”\n* The term “yoke” is also often used figuratively to refer to a heavy load that someone has to carry, such as when being oppressed by slavery or persecution.\n* In most contexts, it is best to translate this term literally, using the local term for a yoke that is used for farming.\n* Other ways to translate the figurative use of this term could be, “oppressive burden” or “heavy load” or “bond,” depending on the context.\n\n(See also: [bind](../kt/bond.md), [burden](../other/burden.md), [oppress](../other/oppress.md), [persecute](../other/persecute.md), [servant](../other/servant.md))\n\n## Bible References:\n\n* [Acts 15:10](rc://en/tn/help/act/15/10)\n* [Galatians 5:1](rc://en/tn/help/gal/05/01)\n* [Genesis 27:40](rc://en/tn/help/gen/27/40)\n* [Isaiah 9:4](rc://en/tn/help/isa/09/04)\n* [Jeremiah 27:4](rc://en/tn/help/jer/27/04)\n* [Matthew 11:30](rc://en/tn/help/mat/11/30)\n* [Philippians 4:3](rc://en/tn/help/php/04/03)\n\n## Word Data:\n\n* Strong’s: H3627, H4132, H4133, H5674, H5923, H6776, G20860, G22180\n"
